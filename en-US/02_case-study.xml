  <title>Presenting the Case Study</title>
  <highlights>
    <para>You are the system administrator of a growing small business. In
    collaboration with your directors, you come to redefine the information
    systems master plan for the coming year, and you choose to
    progressively migrate to Debian for reasons as much practical as
    economic. Let's see into more detail what's ahead of you...</para>
  </highlights>

  <para>We have envisioned this case study to approach all modern
  information system services currently used in a medium sized company.
  After reading this book, you will have all of the elements necessary to
  install Debian on your servers and fly on your own wings. You will also
  learn how to effectively find information in the event of
  difficulties.</para>

    <title>Fast Growing IT Needs</title>

    <para>Falcot Corp is a manufacturer of high quality audio equipment.
    The company is growing strongly, and has two facilities, one in
    Saint-Étienne, and another in Pau. The first has around 150 employees;
    it hosts a factory for the manufacturing of speakers, a design lab, and
    all administrative office. The Pau site, which is smaller, only has
    about 50 workers, and produces amplifiers.</para>

      <title><emphasis>NOTE</emphasis> Fictional company created for case study</title>

      <para>The company, Falcot Corp, studied here, is completely
      fictional. Any resemblance to an existing company is purely
      coincidental. Likewise, certain example data throughout this book may
      be fictional.</para>
    </sidebar>

    <para>The computer system has had difficulty keeping up with the
    company's growth, so they are now determined to completely redefine it
    to meet various goals established by management:</para>

    <para>With your collaboration, IT management has conducted a slightly
    more extensive study, identifying some constraints and defining a plan
    for migration to the chosen Open Source system, Debian.</para>

    <para>A significant constraint identified is that the accounting
    department uses specific software, which only runs on
    <trademark>Microsoft Windows</trademark>. The laboratory, for its part,
    uses computer aided design software that runs on
    <trademark>MacOS X</trademark>.</para>

    <para>The switch to Debian will be gradual; a small business, with
    limited means, can not change everything overnight. For starters, the
    IT staff must be trained in Debian administration. The servers will
    then be converted, starting with the network infrastructure (routers,
    firewalls, etc.) followed by the user services (file sharing, Web,
    SMTP, etc.). Then the office computers will be gradually migrated to
    Debian, for each department to be trained (internally) during the
    deployment of the new system.</para>

  <section id="sect.why-gnu-linux">
    <title>Why a GNU/Linux Distribution?</title>

    <sidebar>
      <title><emphasis>BACK TO BASICS</emphasis> Linux or GNU/Linux?</title>
      <indexterm><primary>GNU/Linux</primary></indexterm>
      <indexterm><primary>Linux</primary></indexterm>

      <para>Linux, as you already know, is only a kernel. The expressions,
      “Linux distribution” and “Linux system” are, thus, incorrect:
      they are, in reality, distributions or systems <emphasis>based
      on</emphasis> Linux. These expressions fail to mention the software
      that always complete this kernel, among which are the programs
      developed by the GNU Project. Dr. Richard Stallman, founder of this
      project, insists that the expression “GNU/Linux” be
      systematically used, in order to better recognize the important
      contributions made by the GNU Project and the principles of freedom
      upon which they are founded.</para>

      <para>Debian has chosen to follow this recommendation, and, thus,
      name its distributions accordingly (thus, the latest stable release
      is Debian GNU/Linux 6.0).</para>
    </sidebar>

    <para>Several factors have dictated this choice. The system
    administrator, who was familiar with this distribution, ensured it was
    listed among the candidates for the computer system overhaul. Difficult
    economic conditions and ferocious competition have limited the budget
    for this operation, despite its critical importance for the future of
    the company. This is why Open Source solutions were swiftly chosen:
    several recent studies indicate they are less expensive than
    proprietary solutions, despite quality of service that is equal or
    better, so long as personnel qualified to run them are
    available.</para>

    <sidebar>
      <title><emphasis>IN PRACTICE</emphasis> Total cost of ownership (TCO)</title>
      <indexterm><primary>TCO</primary></indexterm>
      <indexterm><primary>Total Cost of Ownership</primary></indexterm>

      <para>The Total Cost of Ownership is the total of all money expended
      for the possession or acquisition of an item, in this case referring
      to the operating system. This price includes any possible license fee,
      costs for training personnel to work with the new software,
      replacement of machines that are too slow, additional repairs, etc.
      Everything arising directly from the initial choice is taken into
      account.</para>

      <para>This TCO, which varies according to the criteria chosen in the
      assessment thereof, is rarely significant, in itself. However, it is
      very interesting to compare the TCO calculated according to the same
      rules. This assessment table is, thus, of paramount importance, and
      it is easy to manipulate it in order to draw a predefined conclusion.
      Thus, the TCO for a single machine doesn't make sense, since the cost
      of an administrator is also reflected in the total number of machines
      they manage, a number which obviously depends on the operating system
      and tools proposed.</para>
    </sidebar>

    <para>Among free operating systems, the IT department looked at the
    free BSD systems (OpenBSD, FreeBSD, and NetBSD), GNU Hurd, and Linux
    distributions. GNU Hurd, which has not yet released a stable version,
    was immediately rejected. The choice is simpler between BSD and Linux.
    The former have many merits, especially on servers. Pragmatism
    indicates, however, the choice of a Linux system since, its installed
    base and popularity are both very significant and have numerous
    positive consequences. Consequent to this popularity, it is easier to
    find qualified personnel to administer Linux machines than technicians
    experienced with BSD. Furthermore, Linux adapts to newer hardware
    faster than BSD (although they are often neck and neck in this race).
    Finally, Linux distributions are often more adapted to user-friendly
    graphical user interfaces, indispensable for beginners during migration
    of all office machines to a new system.</para>

      <para>Since Debian <emphasis role="distribution">Squeeze</emphasis>,
      it is possible to use Debian with a FreeBSD kernel on 32 and 64 bit
      computers; this is what the architectures,
      <literal>kfreebsd-i386</literal> and
      <literal>kfreebsd-amd64</literal> mean. While these architectures are
      labeled “experimental” (Technology Preview), already 70 to 80% of
      software packaged by Debian is available for them.</para>

      <para>These architectures may be an appropriate choice for Falcot
      Corp administrators, especially for a firewall (the kernel supports
      three different firewalls: IPF, IPFW, PF) or for a NAS (network
      attached storage system, for which the ZFS filesystem has been tested
      and approved).</para>
    </sidebar>
  </section>
  <section id="sect.why-debian">
    <title>Why the Debian Distribution?</title>

    <para>Once Linux has been endorsed, a more specific option must be
    chosen. Again, the criteria to consider abound. The distribution chosen
    must be able to operate for several years, since the migration from one
    to another would entail additional costs (although less than if the
    migration were between two totally different operating systems, such as
    Windows or Mac OS).</para>

    <para>Sustainability is, thus, essential, and it must guarantee regular
    updates and security patches over several years. The timing of updates
    is also significant, since, with so many machines to manage, Falcot
    Corp can not handle this complex operation too frequently. The IT
    department, therefore, insists on running the latest stable version of
    the distribution, benefiting from the best technical assistance, and
    guaranteed security patches. In effect, security updates are generally
    only guaranteed for a limited duration on older versions of a
    distribution.</para>

    <para>Finally, for reasons of homogeneity and ease of administration,
    the same distribution must run on all the servers (some of which are
    Sparc machines, currently running Solaris) and office computers.</para>
    <section>
      <title>Commercial and Community Driven Distributions</title>

      <para>There are two main categories of Linux distributions:
      commercial and community driven. The former, developed by companies,
      are sold with commercial support services. The latter are developed
      according to the same open development model as the free software of
      which they are comprised.</para>

      <para>A commercial distribution will have, thus, a tendency to
      release new versions more frequently, in order to better market
      updates and associated services. Their future is directly connected
      to the commercial success of their company, and many have already
      disappeared (Caldera Linux, StormLinux, etc.).</para>

      <para>A community distribution doesn't follow any schedule but its
      own. Like the Linux kernel, new versions are released when they are
      stable, never before. Its survival is guaranteed, as long as it has
      enough individual developers or third party companies to support
      it.</para>
      <indexterm><primary>distribution</primary><secondary>community Linux distribution</secondary></indexterm>
      <indexterm><primary>distribution</primary><secondary>commercial Linux distribution</secondary></indexterm>

      <para>A comparison of various Linux distributions led to the choice
      of Debian for various reasons:</para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
	  <para>It is a community distribution, with development ensured
	  independently from any commercial constraints; its objectives
	  are, thus, essentially of a technical nature, which seem to favor
	  the overall quality of the product.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
	  <para>Of all community distributions, it is the most significant
	  from any perspective: in number of contributors, number of
	  software packages available, and years of continuous existence.
	  The size of its community is an incontestable witness to its
	  continuity.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
	  <para>Statistically, new versions are released every 18 to 24
	  months, a schedule which is agreeable to administrators.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
	  <para>A survey of several French service companies specialized in
	  free software has shown that all of them provide technical
	  assistance for Debian; it is also, for many of them, their chosen
	  distribution, internally. This diversity of potential providers
	  is a major asset for Falcot Corp's independence.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
	  <para>Finally, Debian is available on a multitude of
	  architectures, including Sparc; it will, thus, be possible to
	  install it on Falcot Corp's several Sun servers.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>Once Debian has been chosen, the matter of which version to use
      must be decided. Let's see why the administrators have picked Debian
      Squeeze.</para>
    </section>
  </section>
  <section id="section.why-debian-stable">
    <title>Why Debian Squeeze?</title>

    <para>At the time of this writing, Debian Squeeze was still the
    “<emphasis role="distribution">Testing</emphasis>” distribution,
    but now, while you are reading, it will be the new “<emphasis
    role="distribution">Stable</emphasis>” version of Debian. This is
    also the reason for which we speak of “Debian Squeeze”, rather than
    “Debian 6.0”, since the version number is not used prior to its
    effective release.</para>

    <para>You may note a few minor differences between what is written here
    and what you observe in practice, even though we have limited these
    discrepancies as much as possible.</para>

    <sidebar>
      <title>
        <emphasis>PARTICIPATE</emphasis>
      </title>

      <para>Do not hesitate to indicate any error herein to us by e-mail;
      You can reach Raphaël at <email>hertzog@debian.org</email>, and
      Roland at <email>lolando@debian.org</email>.</para>
    </sidebar>

    <para>The choice of Debian Squeeze is well justified based on the fact
    that any administrator concerned about the quality of their servers
    will naturally gravitate towards the stable version of Debian.
    Furthermore, this distribution introduces numerous interesting changes:
    support for the latest virtualization technologies (KVM), simplified
    PAM configuration, an improved installer supporting BTRFS, all bringing
    improvements that directly affect administrators.</para>
