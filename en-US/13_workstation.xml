    <para>The initial configuration for the graphical interface can be
    awkward at times; very recent video cards often don't work perfectly
    with the X.org version shipped in the Debian stable version.</para>

    <para>A brief reminder: X.org is the software component that allows
    graphical applications to display windows on screen. It includes a
    driver that makes efficient use of the video card. The features offered
    to the graphical applications are exported through a standard
    interface, <emphasis>X11</emphasis> (<emphasis
    role="distribution">Wheezy</emphasis> contains its
    <emphasis>X11R7.7</emphasis> version).</para>

    <sidebar>
      <title><emphasis>PERSPECTIVE</emphasis> X11, XFree86 and X.org</title>

      <para>X11 is the graphical system most widely used on Unix-like
      systems (also available, in addition to the native system, for
      Windows and Mac OS). Strictly speaking, the “X11” term only
      refers to a protocol specification, but it's also used to refer to
      the implementation in practice.</para>

      <para>X11 had a rough start, but the 1990's saw XFree86 emerge as the
      reference implementation because it was free software, portable, and
      maintained by a collaborative community. However, the rate of
      evolution slowed down near the end when the software only gained new
      drivers. That situation, along with a very controversial license
      change, led to the X.org fork in 2004. This is now the reference
      implementation, and Debian <emphasis
      role="distribution">Wheezy</emphasis> uses X.org version 7.7.</para>
    </sidebar>

    <para>Current versions of X.org are able to autodetect the available
    hardware: this applies to the video card and the monitor, as well as
    keyboards and mice; in fact, it's so convenient that the package no
    longer even creates a <filename>/etc/X11/xorg.conf</filename>
    configuration file. This is all made possible by features provided by
    the Linux 2.6 kernel (in particular for keyboards and mice), by having
    each driver list the video cards it supports, and by using the DDC
    protocol to fetch monitor characteristics.</para>
    <indexterm><primary>resolution</primary></indexterm>

    <para>The keyboard configuration is currently set up in
    <filename>/etc/default/keyboard</filename>. This file is used both to
    configure the text console and the graphical interface, and it is
    handled by the <emphasis role="pkg">keyboard-configuration</emphasis>
    package. Details on configuring the keyboard layout are available in
    <xref linkend="sect.config-clavier"/>.</para>

    <para>The <emphasis role="pkg">xserver-xorg-core</emphasis> package provides
    a generic X server, as used by the 7.x versions of X.org. This server
    is modular and uses a set of independent drivers to handle the many
    different kinds of video cards. Installing <emphasis
    role="pkg">xserver-xorg</emphasis> ensures that both the server and
    at least one video driver are installed.</para>
    <indexterm><primary>server</primary><secondary>X</secondary></indexterm>
    <indexterm><primary><emphasis role="pkg">xserver-xorg</emphasis></primary></indexterm>

    <para>Note that if the detected video card is not handled by any
    of the available drivers, X.org tries using the VESA and fbdev
    drivers. The former is a generic driver that should work
    everywhere, but with limited capabilities (fewer available
    resolutions, no hardware acceleration for games and visual effects
    for the desktop, and so on) while the latter works on top of the
    kernel's framebuffer device. The X server writes its messages to
    the <filename>/var/log/Xorg.0.log</filename> log file, which is
    where one would look to know what driver is currently in use. For
    example, the following snippet matches what the
    <literal>intel</literal> driver outputs when it is loaded:</para>

    <programlisting>
(==) Matched intel as autoconfigured driver 0
(==) Matched vesa as autoconfigured driver 1
(==) Matched fbdev as autoconfigured driver 2
(==) Assigned the driver to the xf86ConfigLayout
(II) LoadModule: "intel"
(II) Loading /usr/lib/xorg/modules/drivers/intel_drv.so

      <title><emphasis>EXTRA</emphasis> Proprietary drivers</title>

      <para>Some video card makers (most notably nVidia) refuse to publish
      the hardware specifications that would be required to implement good
      free drivers. They do, however, provide proprietary drivers that
      allow using their hardware. This policy is nefarious, because even
      when the provided driver exists, it is usually not as polished as it
      should be; more importantly, it does not necessarily follow the X.org
      updates, which may prevent the latest available driver from loading
      correctly (or at all). We cannot condone this behavior, and we
      recommend you avoid these makers and favor more cooperative
      manufacturers.</para>

      <para>If you still end up with such a card, you will find the
      required packages in the <emphasis>non-free</emphasis> section:
      <emphasis role="pkg">nvidia-glx</emphasis> for nVidia cards, and
      <emphasis role="pkg">fglrx-driver</emphasis> for some ATI cards. Both
      cases require matching kernel modules. Building these modules can be
      automated by installing the <emphasis
      role="pkg">nvidia-kernel-dkms</emphasis> (for nVidia), or <emphasis
      role="pkg">fglrx-modules-dkms</emphasis> (for ATI) packages.</para>

      <para>The “nouveau” project aims to develop a free software
      driver for nVidia cards. As of <emphasis
      role="distribution">Wheezy</emphasis>, its feature set does not
      match the proprietary driver. In the developers' defense, we should
      mention that the required information can only be gathered by reverse
      engineering, which makes things difficult. The free driver for ATI
      video cards, called “radeon”, is much better in that
      regard although it often requires a non-free firmware.</para>

      <para>The graphical interface only provides display
      space. Running the X server by itself only leads to an empty
      screen, which is why most installations use a <emphasis>display
      manager</emphasis> to display a user authentication screen and
      start the graphical desktop once the user has authenticated. The
      three most popular display managers in current use are <emphasis
      role="pkg">gdm3</emphasis> (<foreignphrase>GNOME Display
      Manager</foreignphrase>), <emphasis role="pkg">kdm</emphasis>
      (<foreignphrase>KDE Display Manager</foreignphrase>) and
      <emphasis role="pkg">xdm</emphasis> (<foreignphrase>X Display
      Manager</foreignphrase>). Since the Falcot Corp administrators
      have opted to use the GNOME desktop environment, they logically
      picked <command>gdm3</command> as a display manager too. The
      <filename>/etc/gdm3/daemon.conf</filename> configuration file
      has many options.  Up to <emphasis
      role="distribution">Squeeze</emphasis>, some of these options
      could be set by <command>gdmsetup</command>, a graphical
      interface for <command>gdm3</command> configuration that could be
      run from the
      <menuchoice><guimenu>System</guimenu><guisubmenu>Administration</guisubmenu>
      <guimenuitem>Display screen</guimenuitem></menuchoice> menu in
      the GNOME desktop.  This tool is no longer available in <emphasis

	rewrite, but it is still rather young: many of the options provided
	by previous versions have been removed, and the
	<command>gdmsetup</command> configuration interface is much more
	limited in scope. This explains why both versions are available in
	<emphasis role="distribution">Squeeze</emphasis>. Note, however,
	the 2.x versions will be removed from the next stable Debian

      <title>Choosing a Window Manager</title>

      <para>Since each graphical desktop provides its own window
      manager, choosing the former usually implies software selections
      from the latter. GNOME uses the <command>mutter</command> window
      manager (or <command>metacity</command> when run in GNOME
      Classic mode), KDE uses <command>kwin</command>, and Xfce (which
      we present later) has <command>xfwm</command>. The Unix
      philosophy always allows using one's window manager of choice,
      but following the recommendations allows an administrator to
      best take advantage of the integration efforts led by each
      project.</para>

	<para>True to the Unix tradition of doing one thing only but doing
	it well, the window manager displays the “decorations” around
	the windows belonging to the currently running applications, which
	includes frames and the title bar. It also allows reducing,
	restoring, maximizing, and hiding windows. Most window managers
	also provide a menu that pops up when the desktop is clicked in a
	specific way. This menu provides the means to close the window
	manager session, starting new applications, and in some cases,
	change to another window manager (if installed).</para>
      </sidebar>

      <para>Older computers may, however, have a hard time running
      heavyweight graphical desktop environments. In these cases, a lighter
      configuration should be used. “Light” (or small footprint) window
      managers include WindowMaker (in the <emphasis
      role="pkg">wmaker</emphasis> package), Afterstep, fvwm, icewm,
      blackbox, fluxbox, or openbox. In these cases, the system should be configured so that the
      appropriate window manager gets precedence; the standard way is to
      change the <command>x-window-manager</command> alternative with the
      <command>update-alternatives --config x-window-manager</command>
      command.</para>

        <indexterm><primary><command>update-alternatives</command></primary></indexterm>

	<para>The Debian policy lists a number of standardized commands
	able to perform a particular action. For example, the
	<command>x-window-manager</command> command invokes a window
	manager. But Debian does not assign this command to a fixed window
	manager. The administrator can choose which manager it should
	invoke.</para>

	<para>For each window manager, the relevant package therefore
	registers the appropriate command as a possible choice for
	<command>x-window-manager</command> along with an associated
	priority. Barring explicit configuration by the administrator, this
	priority allows picking the best installed window manager when the
	generic command is run.</para>

	<para>Both the registration of commands and the explicit
	configuration involve the <command>update-alternatives</command>
	script. Choosing where a symbolic command points at is a simple
	matter of running <command>update-alternatives --config
	<replaceable>symbolic-command</replaceable></command>. The
	<command>update-alternatives</command> script creates (and
	maintains) symbolic links in the
	<filename>/etc/alternatives/</filename> directory, which in turn
	references the location of the executable. As time passes, packages
	are installed or removed, and/or the administrator makes explicit
	changes to the configuration. When a package providing an
	alternative is removed, the alternative automatically goes to the
	next best choice among the remaining possible commands.</para>

	<para>Not all symbolic commands are explicitly listed by the Debian
	policy; some Debian package maintainers deliberately chose to use
	this mechanism in less straightforward cases where it still brings
	interesting flexibility (examples include
	<command>x-www-browser</command>, <command>www-browser</command>,
	<command>cc</command>, <command>c++</command>,

      <title>Menu Management</title>
      <indexterm><primary><command>menu</command></primary></indexterm>
      <indexterm><primary><command>update-menus</command></primary></indexterm>

      <para>Modern desktop environments and many window managers provide
      menus listing the available applications for the user. In order to
      keep menus up-to-date in relation to the actual set of available
      applications, Debian created a centralized database registering all
      installed applications. A newly installed package registers itself in
      that database, and tells the system to update the menus accordingly.
      This infrastructure is handled in the <emphasis
      role="pkg">menu</emphasis> package.</para>

      <para>When a package provides an application that should appear in
      the menu system, it stores a file in the
      <filename>/usr/share/menu/</filename> directory. That file describes
      some of the application features (including whether it's a graphical
      application or not), and the best location for it in the menu
      hierarchy. The post-installation script for this package then runs
      the <command>update-menus</command> command, which in turn updates
      all the required files. This command cannot know all the menu types
      used by installed applications. As a consequence, packages able to
      display a menu must provide an executable script that will be invoked
      with all the required information from the menu file; the script
      should then turn this information into elements that the application
      with the menu can use. These filter scripts are installed in the
      <filename>/etc/menu-methods/</filename> directory.

        <title><emphasis>GOING FURTHER</emphasis> Menus standardization</title>
        <indexterm><primary><filename>.desktop</filename></primary></indexterm>

	<para>Debian provides its own menu system, but both GNOME and KDE
	developed their own menu management solutions as well. The two
	projects agreed on a format for these menus — more precisely, a
	common format for the <filename>.desktop</filename> files that
	represent menu elements — under the FreeDesktop.org umbrella
	project. <ulink type="block"
	url="http://www.freedesktop.org/"/></para>

	<para>The Debian developers have kept a close eye on this
	project and <filename>.desktop</filename> files can be
	generated from the Debian menu system. However, neither GNOME
	nor KDE use the Debian menu. They both prefer keeping complete
	control over their menus.  Up to <emphasis
	role="distribution">Squeeze</emphasis>, it used to be possible
	to enable a “Debian” submenu containing the official menu as
	maintained by Debian: in GNOME, the menu editor (in the
	<emphasis role="pkg">alacarte</emphasis> package) is available
	by right-clicking on the panel menu, then choosing “Edit
	menus”.  The menu-editing process is still available in
	<emphasis role="distribution">Wheezy</emphasis>, but the
	Debian submenu is no longer available.</para>
      </sidebar>

      <para>The administrator can also have a say in the process and in the
      resulting generated menus. First, they can delete a menu element even
      when the matching application is installed, by simply storing in
      <filename>/etc/menu/</filename> an empty file named according to the
      package providing the entries to be disabled. Second, the menu can be
      reorganized and sections renamed or grouped. The
      <filename>/etc/menu-methods/translate_menus</filename> file is where
      this reorganization is defined and contains commented examples. Finally,
      new elements can be added to the menu, for example to start programs
      installed outside the packaging system, or to run a particular
      command such as starting a web browser on a particular page. These
      extra elements are specified in
      <filename>/etc/menu/local.<replaceable>element</replaceable></filename>
      files, which have the same format as other menu files available under
      <filename>/usr/share/menu/</filename>.</para>

    <title>Graphical Desktops</title>

    <para>The free graphical desktop field is dominated by two large
    software collections: GNOME and KDE. Both of them are very popular.
    This is rather a rare instance in the free software world; the Apache
    web server, for instance, has very few peers.</para>

    <indexterm><primary>Qt</primary></indexterm>

    <para>This diversity is rooted in history. KDE was the first graphical
    desktop project, but it chose the Qt graphical toolkit and that choice
    wasn't acceptable for a large number of developers. Qt was not free
    software at the time, and GNOME was started based on the GTK+ toolkit.
    Qt became free software in the interval, but the projects haven't
    merged and evolved in parallel instead.</para>

    <para>GNOME and KDE still work together: under the FreeDesktop.org
    umbrella, the projects collaborated in defining standards for
    interoperability across applications.</para>

    <para>Choosing “the best” graphical desktop is a sensitive topic

      <title>GNOME</title>

      <para>Debian <emphasis role="distribution">Wheezy</emphasis>
      includes GNOME version 3.4, which can be installed by a simple
      <command>apt-get install gnome</command> (it can also be installed by
      selecting the “Graphical desktop environment” task).</para>
      <indexterm><primary><emphasis role="pkg">gnome</emphasis></primary></indexterm>

      <para>GNOME is noteworthy for its efforts in usability and
      accessibility. Design professionals have been involved in writing
      standards and recommendations. This has helped developers to create
      satisfying graphical user interfaces. The project also gets
      encouragement from the big players of computing, such as Intel, IBM,
      Oracle, Novell, and of course, various Linux distributions. Finally,
      many programming languages can be used in developing applications
      interfacing to GNOME.</para>

      <para>It took quite some time for the GNOME project to build up this
      infrastructure, which can account for a seemingly less mature desktop
      than KDE. The usability and accessibility efforts, in particular, are
      recent, and the benefits have only started to show in the latest
      versions of the environment.</para>

      <para>For administrators, GNOME seems to be better prepared for
      massive deployments. Application configuration is handled by two
      registries, GSettings (the current standard) and GConf (the old
      system used in GNOME 2.x, and still used by a few GNOME 3.x
      applications).  These registries can be queried and edited with
      the <command>gsettings</command> and
      <command>gconftool-2</command> command-line tools. The
      administrator can therefore change users' configuration with a
      simple script. The following website lists all information of

      <para>KDE has had a rapid evolution based on a very hands-on
      approach. Its authors quickly got very good results, which allowed

      <para>Since the Qt 4.0 release, the last remaining license problem

      manager, window manager, session manager, a panel for application
      launchers and so on), it only provides a few specific applications: a
      very lightweight web browser (Midori), a terminal, a calendar, an

      sound volume control.</para>

	  <para>This information is a great help to the Debian project. It

	<para>The rationale behind this renaming is a result of the usage
	rules imposed by the Mozilla Foundation on the

	named Firefox must use the official Firefox logo and icons.
	However, since these elements are not released under a free
	license, Debian cannot distribute them in its

	browser to <emphasis>non-free</emphasis>, the package maintainer
	chose to use a different name.</para>

	life. This was the beginning of the Mozilla project. After many
	years of development, the results are more than satisfying: the
	Mozilla project brought forth an HTML rendering engine (called
	Gecko) that is among the most standard-compliant. This rendering
	engine is in particular used by the Mozilla Firefox browser, which
	is one of the most successful browsers, with a fast-growing user

      Its clear purpose is to make web services more attractive, both by

	<para>A previous edition of this book mentioned

	<para><emphasis>eGroupware</emphasis> was also mentioned, but it

	<para>All is not lost though. Many of the features

	  <para>IRC can also be considered, instead of Jabber. This system
	  is more centered around the concept of channels, the name of
	  which starts with a hash sign <literal>#</literal>. Each channel
	  is usually targeted at a specific topic and any number of people
	  can join a channel to discuss it (but users can still have
	  one-to-one private conversations if needed). The IRC protocol is
	  older, and does not allow end-to-end encryption of the messages;
	  it is still possible to encrypt the communications between the
	  users and the server by tunneling the IRC protocol inside
	  SSL.</para>

	  <para>IRC clients are a bit more complex, and they usually

	  endowed with the ability to kick other users from a channel, or
	  even ban them permanently, when the normal discussion is
	  disrupted.</para>

	  <para>Since the IRC protocol is very old, many clients are
	  available to cater for many user groups; examples include XChat

	  TCP ports 30000 to 30010 (for control of open connections) and

	  executing <command>dpkg-reconfigure ejabberd</command> will allow
	  customizing the default domain, and create an administrator
	  account. Note that the Jabber server needs a valid DNS name to
	  point at it, so some network administration can be required
	  beforehand. The Falcot Corp administrators picked
	  <literal>jabber.falcot.com</literal> for that purpose.</para>

	  <para>Once this initial set up is over, the service configuration
	  can be controlled through a web interface accessible at
	  <literal>http://jabber.falcot.com:5280/admin/</literal>. The

	  during the initial configuration. Note that the username must be
	  qualified with the configured domain: the
	  <literal>admin</literal> account becomes
	  <literal>admin@jabber.falcot.com</literal>.</para>

	  <para>The web interface removes the need to edit a configuration
	  file, but does not always make the task easier, since many

	<para>FusionForge is a collaborative development tool with some
	ancestry in SourceForge, a hosting service for free software
	projects. It takes the same overall approach based on the standard
	development model for free software. The software itself has kept
	evolving after the SourceForge code went proprietary. Its initial
	authors, VA Software, decided not to release any more free
	versions. The same happened again when the first fork (GForge)
	followed the same path. Since various people and organizations have
	participated in development, the current FusionForge also includes
	features targeting a more traditional approach to development, as
	well as projects not purely concerned with software
	development.</para>
        <indexterm><primary>SourceForge</primary></indexterm>

	<para>FusionForge can be seen as an amalgamation of several tools
	dedicated to manage, track and coordinate projects. These tools can
	be roughly classified into three families:</para>
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
	    <para><emphasis>communication</emphasis>: web forums,
	    mailing-list manager, announcement system allowing a project to

          </listitem>
          <listitem>
	    <para><emphasis>tracking</emphasis>: task tracker to control
	    progress and schedule tasks, trackers for bugs (or patches or
	    feature requests, or any other kind of “ticket”),
	    surveys;</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
	    <para><emphasis>sharing</emphasis>: documentation manager to
	    provide a single central point for documents related to a
	    project, generic file release manager, dedicated website for
	    each project.</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

	<para>Since FusionForge is largely targeting development projects,
	it also integrates many tools such as CVS, Subversion, Git, Bazaar,
	Darcs, Mercurial and Arch for source control management or
	“configuration management” or “version control” — this
	process has many names. These programs keep a history of all the
	revisions of all tracked files (often source code files), with all
	the changes they go through, and they can merge modifications when
	several developers work simultaneously on the same part of a
	project.</para>

	<para>Most of these tools are accessible, or even managed, through
	a web interface, with a fine-grained permission system, and email
	notifications for some events.</para>

        <para>Unfortunately, FusionForge was in a state of flux when

      of Libre Office as a variant. The GNOME and KDE projects are
      still working on their offerings (GNOME Office and KOffice), and
      the friendly competition leads to interesting results. For
      instance, the Gnumeric spreadsheet (part of GNOME Office) is
      even better than OpenOffice.org/Libre Office in some domains,
      notably the precision of its calculations. On the word

      <para>Another important feature for users is the ability to
      import Word and Excel documents received from contacts or found
      in archives.  Even though all office suites have filters which
      allow working on these formats, only the ones found in
      OpenOffice.org and Libre Office are functional enough for daily
      use.</para>

        <title><emphasis>THE BROADER VIEW</emphasis> Libre Office replaces OpenOffice.org</title>

	<para>OpenOffice.org contributors have set up a foundation
	(<emphasis>The Document Foundation</emphasis>) to foster project
	development. The idea had been discussed for some time, but the
	actual trigger was Oracle's acquisition of Sun. The new ownership
	made the future of OpenOffice under Oracle uncertain. Since Oracle
	declined to join the foundation, the developers had to give up on
	the OpenOffice.org name. The software is now known as
	<emphasis>Libre Office</emphasis>.  After a period of relative
	stagnation on the OpenOffice.org front, Oracle decided to
	migrate the code and associated rights to the Apache Software
	Foundation, and OpenOffice is now an Apache project.</para>

	<para>Debian <emphasis role="distribution">Squeeze</emphasis>
	contained OpenOffice.org due to the timing of events… but
	Libre Office was rapidly made available in the
	<literal>backports.debian.org</literal> package repository.
	Debian <emphasis role="distribution">Wheezy</emphasis>
	includes only Libre Office, and the <emphasis
	role="pkg">openoffice.org*</emphasis> packages are merely
	transitional packages.  The OpenOffice software suite as
	published by the Apache Software Foundation is not currently
	available in Debian.</para>

    <title>Emulating Windows: Wine</title>
    <indexterm><primary>Emulating Windows</primary></indexterm>
    <indexterm><primary>Windows, emulation</primary></indexterm>

    <para>In spite of all the previously mentioned efforts, there are still
    a number of tools without a Linux equivalent, or for which the original
    version is absolutely required. This is where Windows emulation systems
    come in handy. The most well-known among them is Wine. <ulink
    type="block" url="http://www.winehq.com/"/></para>

    <sidebar>
      <title><emphasis>COMPLEMENTS</emphasis> CrossOver Linux</title>

      <para><emphasis>CrossOver</emphasis>, produced by CodeWeavers, is a
      set of enhancements to Wine that broaden the available set of
      emulated features to a point at which Microsoft Office becomes fully
      usable. Some of the enhancements are periodically merged into Wine.

    </sidebar>

    <para>However, one should keep in mind that it's only a solution among
    others, and the problem can also be tackled with a virtual machine or
    VNC; both of these solutions are detailed in the sidebars.</para>

    <para>Let us start with a reminder: emulation allows executing a
    program (developed for a target system) on a different host system. The
    emulation software uses the host system, where the application runs, to
    imitate the required features of the target system.</para>
    <indexterm><primary>Wine</primary></indexterm>

    <para>The simplest way of using Wine is with an instance of Microsoft
    Windows already installed on an existing partition (which will be the
    case on machines dual-booting with this system). When no installed
    Windows version is available, Wine works in a less complete way, and
    fewer programs will be able to run.</para>

    <para>The Windows partition must first be mounted (for instance under
    <filename>/windows/</filename>), and the <command>wine</command> user
    must have read and write access. The following
    <filename>fstab</filename> entry grants this access to all
    users:</para>

    <programlisting>
/dev/hda1 /windows fat defaults,uid=1000,gid=100,umask=002,nls=iso8859-1 0 0
</programlisting>

    <para>Now let's install the required packages:</para>

    <screen>
<computeroutput># </computeroutput><userinput>apt-get install wine ttf-mscorefonts-installer wine-doc</userinput>
</screen>
    <indexterm><primary><command>winesetup</command></primary></indexterm>

    <para>The user then needs to run <command>winecfg</command> and
    configure <filename>/windows/</filename> to be used as the
    <literal>C:</literal> drive. Other settings can be kept to their
    default values. Running Windows programs then becomes a simple matter
    of running <command>wine
    <replaceable>/windows/.../program.exe</replaceable></command>.</para>

    <para>Note that you should not rely on Wine (or similar solutions)
    without actually testing the particular software: only a real-use test
    will determine conclusively whether emulation is fully
    functional.</para>

    <sidebar>
      <title><emphasis>ALTERNATIVE</emphasis> Virtual machines</title>

      <para>An alternative to emulating Microsoft's operating system is to
      actually run it in a virtual machine that emulates a full hardware
      machine. This allows running any operating system. <xref
      linkend="advanced-administration"/> describes several virtualization
      systems, most notably Xen and KVM (but also QEMU, VMWare and
      Bochs).</para>
    </sidebar>

    <sidebar role="important">
      <title><emphasis>ALTERNATIVE</emphasis> <foreignphrase>Windows Terminal Server</foreignphrase> or VNC</title>

      <para>Yet another possibility is to remotely run the legacy Windows
      applications on a central server with <emphasis>Windows Terminal
      Server</emphasis> and access the application from Linux machines
      using <emphasis>rdesktop</emphasis>. This is a Linux client for the
      RDP protocol (<emphasis>Remote Desktop Protocol</emphasis>) that
      <foreignphrase>Windows NT/2000 Terminal Server</foreignphrase> uses
      to display desktops on remote machines.</para>

      <indexterm><primary><emphasis>Remote Desktop Protocol</emphasis></primary></indexterm>
      <indexterm><primary><emphasis>Windows Terminal Server</emphasis></primary></indexterm>

      <para>The VNC software provides similar features, with the added
      benefit of also working with many operating systems. Linux VNC
      clients and servers are described in <xref
      linkend="sect.remote-login"/>.</para>
