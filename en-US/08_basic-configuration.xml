  <title>Basic Configuration: Network, Accounts, Printing...</title>
  <highlights>
    <para>A computer with a new installation created with
    <command>debian-installer</command> is intended to be as functional as
    possible, but many services still have to be configured. Furthermore,
    it is always good to know how to change certain configuration elements
    defined during the initial installation process.</para>
  </highlights>

  <para>This chapter reviews everything included in what we could call the
  “basic configuration”: networking, language and locales, users and
  groups, printing, mount points, etc.</para>

    <para>If the system was installed using French, the machine will
    probably already have French set as the default language. But it is
    good to know what the installer does to set the language, so that
    later, if the need arises, you can change it.</para>

      <title><emphasis>TOOL</emphasis> The <command>locale</command> command to display the current configuration</title>

      <para>The <command>locale</command> command lists a summary of the
      current configuration of various locale parameters (date format,
      numbers format, etc.), presented in the form of a group of standard
      environment variables dedicated to the dynamic modification of these
      settings.</para>

      <para>A locale is a group of regional settings. This includes not
      only the language for text, but also the format for displaying
      numbers, dates, times, and monetary sums, as well as the alphabetical
      comparison rules (to properly account for accented characters).
      Although each of
      these parameters can be specified independently from the others, we
      generally use a locale, which is a coherent set of values for
      these parameters corresponding to a “region” in the broadest
      sense. These locales are usually indicated under the form,
      <literal><replaceable>language-code</replaceable>_<replaceable>COUNTRY-CODE</replaceable></literal>,
      sometimes with a suffix to specify the character set and encoding to
      be used. This enables consideration of idiomatic or typographical
      differences between different regions with a common language.</para>

	<para>Historically, each locale has an associated “character
	set” (group of known characters) and a preferred “encoding”
	(internal representation for characters within the computer).</para>

	<para>The most popular encodings for latin-based languages were
	limited to 256 characters because they opted to use a single byte
	for each character. Since 256 characters was not enough to cover
	all European languages, multiple encodings were needed, and
	that's how we ended up with <emphasis>ISO-8859-1</emphasis>
	(also known as “Latin 1”) up to <emphasis>ISO-8859-15</emphasis>
	(also known as “Latin 9”), among others.</para>

	<para>Working with foreign languages often implied regular switches
	between various encodings and character sets. Furthermore, writing
	multilingual documents led to further, almost intractable problems.
	Unicode (a super-catalog of nearly all writing systems from all of
	the world's languages) was created to work around this problem. One
	of Unicode's encodings, UTF-8, retains all 128 ASCII symbols (7-bit
	codes), but handles other characters differently. Those are preceded
	by a specific escape sequence of a few bits, which implicitly
	defines the length of the character. This allows encoding all
	Unicode characters on a sequence of one or more bytes. Its use
	has been popularized by the fact that it's the default encoding
	in XML documents.</para>

      <para>The <emphasis role="pkg">locales</emphasis> package includes
      all the elements required for proper functioning of
      “localization” of various applications. During installation,
      this package will ask to select a set of supported
      languages. This set can be changed at any time by running
      <command>dpkg-reconfigure locales</command> as root.</para>

      <para>The first question invites you to select “locales” to
      support. Selecting all English locales (meaning those beginning
      with “<literal>en_US</literal>”) is a reasonable choice. Do not
      hesitate to choose other locales if the machine will host foreign
      users. The list of locales enabled on the system is stored in the
      <filename>/etc/locale.gen</filename> file. It is possible to edit
      this file by hand, but you should run <command>locale-gen</command>
      after any modifications. It will generate the necessary files for the
      added locales to work, and remove any obsolete files.</para>

      <para>The second question, entitled “Default locale for the system environment”,
      requests a default locale. The recommended choice in the U.S.A. is
      “<literal>en_US.UTF-8</literal>”. British English speakers will
      prefer “<literal>en_GB.UTF-8</literal>”, and Canadians will
      prefer either “<literal>en_CA.UTF-8</literal>” or, for French,
      “<literal>fr_CA.UTF-8</literal>”. The
      <filename>/etc/default/locale</filename> file will then be modified
      to store this choice. From there, it's picked up by all user sessions
      since PAM will inject its content in the <varname>LANG</varname>
      environment variable.</para>

	a complete environment without localization. Indeed, it's generally
	discouraged to run server programs with localization enabled;
	on the other hand, localization and regional settings are recommended

      <para>Even if the keyboard layout is managed differently
      in console and graphical mode, Debian offers a single

      questions are relevant to the physical keyboard layout (a standard PC
      keyboard in the US will be a “Generic 104 key”), then the layout
      to choose (generally “US”), and then the position of the AltGr
      key (right Alt). Finally comes the question of the key to use for the

    <section id="sect.utf8-migration">
      <title>Migrating to UTF-8</title>

      <para>The generalization of UTF-8 encoding has been a long awaited
      solution to numerous difficulties with interoperability, since it
      facilitates international exchange and removes the arbitrary limits
      on characters that can be used in a document. The one drawback is
      that it had to go through a rather difficult transition phase. Since
      it could not be completely transparent (that is, it could not happen
      at the same time all over the world), two conversion operations
      were required: one on file contents, and the other on filenames.
      Fortunately, the bulk of this migration has been completed and we
      discuss it largely for reference.</para>

      <sidebar>
        <title><emphasis>CULTURE</emphasis> <foreignphrase>Mojibake</foreignphrase> and interpretation errors</title>

	<para>When a text is sent (or stored) without encoding information,
	it is not always possible for the recipient to know with certainty
	what convention to use for determining the meaning of a set of
	bytes. You can usually get an idea by getting statistics on the
	distribution of values present in the text, but that doesn't always
	give a definite answer. When the encoding system chosen for reading
	differs from that used in writing the file, the bytes are
	mis-interpreted, and you get, at best, errors on some characters,
	or, at worst, something completely illegible.</para>

	<para>Thus, if a French text appears normal with the exception of
	accented letters and certain symbols which appear to be replaced
	with sequences of characters like “Ã©” or Ã¨” or
	“Ã§”, it is probably a file encoded as UTF-8 but interpreted
	as ISO-8859-1 or ISO-8859-15. This is a sign of a local
	installation that has not yet been migrated to UTF-8. If, instead,
	you see question marks instead of accented letters — even if
	these question marks seem to also replace a character that should
	have followed the accented letter — it is likely that your
	installation is already configured for UTF-8 and that you have been
	sent a document encoded in Western ISO.</para>

	<para>So much for “simple” cases. These cases only appear in
	Western culture, since Unicode (and UTF-8) was designed to maximize
	the common points with historical encodings for Western languages
	based on the Latin alphabet, which allows recognition of parts of
	the text even when some characters are missing.</para>

	<para>In more complex configurations, which, for example, involve
	two environments corresponding to two different languages that do
	not use the same alphabet, you often get completely illegible
	results — a series of abstract symbols that have nothing to do
	with each other. This is especially common with Asian languages due
	to their numerous languages and writing systems. The Japanese word
	<foreignphrase>mojibake</foreignphrase> has been adopted to
	describe this phenomenon. When it appears, diagnosis is more
	complex and the simplest solution is often to simply migrate to
	UTF-8 on both sides.</para>
      </sidebar>

      <para>As far as file names are concerned, the migration can be
      relatively simple. The <command>convmv</command> tool (in the package
      with the same name) was created specifically for this purpose; it
      allows renaming files from one encoding to another. The use of this
      tool is relatively simple, but we recommend doing it in two steps to
      avoid surprises. The following example illustrates a UTF-8
      environment containing directory names encoded in ISO-8859-15, and
      the use of <command>convmv</command> to rename them.</para>

      <screen><computeroutput>$ </computeroutput><userinput>ls travail/</userinput>
<computeroutput>Ic?nes  ?l?ments graphiques  Textes
$ </computeroutput><userinput>convmv -r -f iso-8859-15 -t utf-8 travail/</userinput>
<computeroutput>Starting a dry run without changes...
mv "travail/�l�ments graphiques"        "travail/Éléments graphiques"
mv "travail/Ic�nes"     "travail/Icônes"
No changes to your files done. Use --notest to finally rename the files.
$ </computeroutput><userinput>convmv -r --notest -f iso-8859-15 -t utf-8 travail/</userinput>
<computeroutput>mv "travail/�l�ments graphiques"        "travail/Éléments graphiques"
mv "travail/Ic�nes"     "travail/Icônes"
Ready!
$ </computeroutput><userinput>ls travail/</userinput>
<computeroutput>Éléments graphiques  Icônes  Textes</computeroutput>
</screen>

      <para>For the file content, conversion procedures are more complex
      due to the vast variety of existing file formats. Some file formats
      include encoding information that facilitates the tasks of the
      software used to treat them; it is sufficient, then, to open these
      files and re-save them specifying UTF-8 encoding. In other cases, you
      have to specify the original encoding (ISO-8859-1 or “Western”,
      or ISO-8859-15 or “Western (Euro)”, according to the
      formulations) when opening the file.</para>

      <para>For simple text files, you can use <command>recode</command>
      (in the package of the same name) which allows automatic recoding.
      This tool has numerous options so you can play with its behavior. We
      recommend you consult the documentation, the <citerefentry>
      <refentrytitle>recode</refentrytitle> <manvolnum>1</manvolnum>
      </citerefentry> man page, or the <citerefentry>

      <para>Most modern local networks use the Ethernet protocol, where
      data is split into small blocks called frames and transmitted on the
      wire one frame at a time. Data speeds vary from 10 Mb/s for older
      Ethernet cards to 10 Gb/s in the newest cards (with the most common
      rate currently growing from 100 Mb/s to 1 Gb/s). The most widely
      used cables are called 10BASE-T, 100BASE-T, 1000BASE-T or 10GBASE-T
      depending on the throughput they can reliably provide (the T stands
      for “twisted pair”); those cables end in an RJ45 connector. There

      <indexterm><primary>address, IP address</primary></indexterm>
      <indexterm><primary>IP address</primary></indexterm>

      <para>An IP address is a number used to identify a network interface
      on a computer on a local network or the Internet. In the currently
      most widespread version of IP (IPv4), this number is encoded in 32
      bits, and is usually represented as 4 numbers separated by periods
      (e.g. <literal>192.168.0.1</literal>), each number being between 0
      and 255 (inclusive, which corresponds to 8 bits of data). The next
      version of the protocol, IPv6, extends this addressing space to 128
      bits, and the addresses are generally represented as series of
      hexadecimal numbers separated by colons (e.g.,
      2001:0db8:13bb:0002:0000:0000:0000:0020, or 2001:db8:13bb:2::20 for

      <indexterm><primary>network</primary><secondary>address</secondary></indexterm>

      <para>A subnet mask (netmask) defines in its binary code which
      portion of an IP address corresponds to the network, the remainder
      specifying the machine. In the example of configuring a static IPv4
      address given here, the subnet mask, <literal>255.255.255.0</literal>
      (24 “1”s followed by 8 “0”s in binary representation)
      indicates that the first 24 bits of the IP address correspond to the
      network address, and the other 8 are specific to the machine. In
      IPv6, for readability, only the number of “1”s is expressed; the
      netmask for an IPv6 network could, thus, be
      <literal>64</literal>.</para>

      <para>The network address is an IP address in which the part
      describing the machine's number is 0. The range of IPv4 addresses in
      a complete network is often indicated by the syntax,
      <emphasis>a.b.c.d/e</emphasis>, in which <emphasis>a.b.c.d</emphasis>
      is the network address and <emphasis>e</emphasis> is the number of
      bits affected to the network part in an IP address. The example
      network would thus be written: <literal>192.168.0.0/24</literal>. The
      syntax is similar in IPv6:
      <literal>2001:db8:13bb:2::/64</literal>.</para>

      <indexterm><primary>bridge</primary></indexterm>

      <para>A router is a machine that connects several networks to each
      other. All traffic coming through a router is guided to the correct
      network. To do this, the router analyzes incoming packets and
      redirects them according to the IP address of their destination. The
      router is often known as a gateway; in this configuration, it works
      as a machine that helps reach out beyond a local network (towards an
      extended network, such as the Internet).</para>

      <indexterm><primary>broadcast</primary></indexterm>

      <para>The special broadcast address connects all the stations in a
      network. Almost never “routed”, it only functions on the network
      in question. Specifically, it means that a data packet addressed to
      the broadcast never passes through the router.</para>

      <para>This chapter focuses on IPv4 addresses, since they are
      currently the most commonly used. The details of the IPv6 protocol
      are approached in <xref linkend="sect.ipv6"/>, but the concepts
      remain the same.</para>
    </sidebar>

    <para>Since the network is automatically configured during the initial
    installation, the <filename>/etc/network/interfaces</filename> file
    already contains a valid configuration. A line starting with

      it's also perfectly usable as the default network management
      tool. You can create “System connections” that are used as soon

      <para>If the computer has an Ethernet card, the IP network that is
      associated with it must be configured by choosing from one of two
      methods. The simplest method is dynamic configuration with DHCP, and
      it requires a DHCP server on the local network. It may indicate a
      desired hostname, corresponding to the <literal>hostname</literal>
      setting in the example below. The DHCP server then sends
      configuration settings for the appropriate network.

      <para>Many Falcot engineers have a laptop computer that, for
      professional purposes, they also use at home. The network
      configuration to use differs according to location. At home, it may
      be a wifi network (protected by a WEP key), while the workplace uses
      a wired network for greater security and more bandwidth.</para>

      <para>To avoid having to manually connect or disconnect the
      corresponding network interfaces, administrators installed the
      <emphasis role="pkg">network-manager</emphasis> package on these
      roaming machines. This software enables a user to easily switch from
      one network to another using a small icon displayed in the
      notification area of their graphical desktop. Clicking on this icon
      displays a list of available networks (both wired and wireless), so
      they can simply choose the network they wish to use. The program
      saves the configuration for the networks to which the user has
      already connected, and automatically switches to the best available
      network when the current connection drops.</para>

      <para>In order to do this, the program is structured in two parts: a
      daemon running as root handles activation and configuration of
      network interfaces and a user interface controls this daemon. PolicyKit
      handles the required authorizations to control this program and Debian
      configured PolicyKit in such a way so that members of the netdev
      group can add or change Network Manager connections.
      </para>

      <para>Network Manager knows how to handle various types of
      connections (DHCP, manual configuration, local network), but only if
      the configuration is set with the program itself. This is why it will
      systematically ignore all network interfaces in
      <filename>/etc/network/interfaces</filename> for which it is not
      suited. Since Network Manager doesn't give details when no network
      connections are shown, the easy way is to delete from

      all interfaces that must be managed by Network Manager.</para>

    <para>The purpose of assigning names to IP numbers is to make them
    easier for people to remember. In reality, an IP address identifies a
    network interface associated with a device such as a network card.
    Since each machine can have several network cards, and several
    interfaces on each card, one single computer can have several names in
    the domain name system.</para>

    <para>Each machine is, however, identified by a main (or
    “canonical”) name, stored in the <filename>/etc/hostname</filename>
    file and communicated to the Linux kernel by initialization scripts
    through the <command>hostname</command> command. The current value is
    available in a virtual filesystem, and you can get it with the

      <para>The <filename>/proc/</filename> and <filename>/sys/</filename>

      virtual files) and communicating them to it (by writing to virtual
      files).</para>

      <para><filename>/sys/</filename> in particular is designed to provide
      access to internal kernel objects, especially those representing the
      various devices in the system. The kernel can, thus, share various
      pieces of information: the status of each device (for example, if it
      is in energy saving mode), whether it is a removable device, etc.
      Note that <filename>/sys/</filename> has only existed since kernel
      version 2.6.</para>
    </sidebar>

    <para>Surprisingly, the domain name is not managed in the same way, but
    comes from the complete name of the machine, acquired through name
    resolution. You can change it in the <filename>/etc/hosts</filename>
    file; simply write a complete name for the machine there at the
    beginning of the list of names associated with the address of the
    machine, as in the following example:</para>

      <para>The mechanism for name resolution in Linux is modular and can

	followed by the list of any associated names (the first being
	“completely qualified”, meaning it includes the domain
	name).</para>

	<para>This file is available even during network outages or when
	DNS servers are unreachable, but will only really be useful when
	duplicated on all the machines on the network. The slightest
	alteration in correspondence will require the file to be updated
	everywhere. This is why <filename>/etc/hosts</filename> generally
	only contains the most important entries.</para>

	<para>This file will be sufficient for a small network not

        <sidebar>
          <title><emphasis>TIP</emphasis> Bypassing DNS</title>

	  <para>Since applications check the

	  DNS-based name resolution.</para>

	  <para>This allows, in the event of DNS changes not yet

	  address yet.</para>

	  <para>Another possible use is to redirect traffic intended for a
	  specific host to the localhost, thus preventing any

      Second, on servers or machines where more than one person could
      potentially access the same file at the same time, take extra steps
      to guard against file corruption.</para>

	<para>Each user may be a member of many groups; one of them is

	is not always desirable; for example, when the user needs to work
	in a directory shared by a group other than their main group. In
	this case, the user needs to change their main group using one of
	the following commands: <command>newgrp</command>, which starts a
	new shell, or <command>sg</command>, which simply executes a
	command using the supplied alternate group. These commands also
	allow the user to join a group to which they do not belong. If the
	group is password protected, they will need to supply the

	<para>Alternatively, the user can set the <literal>setgid</literal>

    <para>One of the first actions an administrator needs to do when

    done using the <command>adduser</command> command which takes a
    user-name for the new user to be created, as an argument.</para>
    <indexterm><primary><command>adduser</command></primary></indexterm>

    <para>The <command>adduser</command> command asks a few questions
    before creating the account, but its usage is fairly straightforward.
    Its configuration file, <filename>/etc/adduser.conf</filename>,
    includes all the interesting settings: it can be used to automatically
    set a quota for each new user by creating a user template, or to change
    the location of user accounts; the latter is rarely useful, but it
    comes in handy when you have a large number of users and want to divide
    their accounts over several disks, for instance. You can also choose a
    different default shell.</para>

    <sidebar>
      <title><emphasis>BACK TO BASICS</emphasis> Quota</title>
      <indexterm><primary>quota</primary></indexterm>

      <para>The term “quota” refers to a limit on machine resources
      that a user is allowed to use. This frequently refers to disk

    </sidebar>

    <para>The creation of an account populates the user's home directory

    <para>In some cases, it will be useful to add a user to a group (other
    than their default “main” group) in order to grant them additional
    permissions. For example, a user who is included in the
    <emphasis>audio</emphasis> group can access audio devices (see sidebar
    “Device access permissions”). This can be achieved with a
    command such as <command>adduser <replaceable>user</replaceable>
    <replaceable>group</replaceable></command>.</para>

      <para>Each hardware peripheral device is represented under Unix with
      a special file, usually stored in the file tree under
      <filename>/dev/</filename> (DEVices). Two types of special files
      exist according to the nature of the device: “character mode” and
      “block mode” files, each mode allowing for only a limited number
      of operations. While character mode limits interaction with
      read/write operations, block mode also allows seeking within the
      available data. Finally, each special file is associated with two
      numbers (“major” and “minor”) that identify the device to the
      kernel in a unique manner. Such a file, created by the
      <command>mknod</command> command, simply contains a symbolic (and
      more human-friendly) name.</para>

      <para>The permissions of a special file map to the permissions
      necessary to access the device itself. Thus, a file such as
      <filename>/dev/mixer</filename>, representing the audio mixer, only
      has read/write permissions for the root user and members of the
      <literal>audio</literal> group. Only these users can operate the
      audio mixer.</para>

      <para>It should be noted that the combination of <emphasis
      role="pkg">udev</emphasis>, <emphasis
      role="pkg">consolekit</emphasis> and <emphasis

    <sidebar>
      <title><emphasis>DISCOVERY</emphasis> Other shells, other scripts</title>

      <para>Each command interpreter has a specific syntax and its own

      <filename>/etc/zshrc</filename> and <filename>/etc/zshenv</filename>;

    <sidebar>
      <title><emphasis>BACK TO BASICS</emphasis> Automatic completion</title>
      <indexterm><primary>automatic completion</primary></indexterm>

      <para>Many command interpreters provide a completion feature, which
      allows the shell to automatically complete a partially typed command
      name or argument when the user hits the <keycap>Tab</keycap> key.
      This lets users work more efficiently and be less error-prone.</para>

      <para>This function is very powerful and flexible. It is possible to
      configure its behavior according to each command. Thus, the first
      argument following <command>apt-get</command> will be proposed
      according to the syntax of this command, even if it does not match
      any file (in this case, the possible choices are
      <literal>install</literal>, <literal>remove</literal>,
      <literal>upgrade</literal>, etc.).</para>

      <para>The tilde is often used to indicate the directory to which the
      environment variable, <varname>HOME</varname>, points (being the
      user's home directory, such as <filename>/home/rhertzog/</filename>).
      Command interpreters automatically make the substitution:
      <filename>~/hello.txt</filename> becomes
      <filename>/home/rhertzog/hello.txt</filename>.</para>

      <para>The tilde also allows access to another user's home directory.

    </sidebar>

    <para>In addition to these common scripts, each user can create their
    own <filename>~/.bashrc</filename> and
    <filename>~/.bash_profile</filename> to configure their shell. The most
    common changes are the addition of aliases; these are words that are
    automatically replaced with the execution of a command, which makes it
    faster to invoke that command. For instance, you could create the
    <literal>la</literal> alias for the command <command>ls -la |

    <command>la</command> to inspect the contents of a directory in

      declare variables which will be passed down to all programs it
      executes.</para>

    <para>Setting default environment variables is an important element of
    shell configuration. Leaving aside the variables specific to a shell,
    it is preferable to place them in the
    <filename>/etc/environment</filename> file, since it is used by the
    various programs likely to initiate a shell session. Variables
    typically defined there include <varname>ORGANIZATION</varname>, which

	of drawbacks among which the fact that it restricted the number of devices
	that one could use (due to the hardcoded list of names), and that it was
	impossible to know which special files were actually useful.</para>

	<para>Nowadays, the management of special files is entirely
	dynamic and matches better the nature of hot-swappable computer
	devices. The kernel cooperates with <emphasis>udev</emphasis> to
	create and delete them as needed when the corresponding devices
	appear and disappear.  For this reason, <filename>/dev/</filename>
	doesn't need to be persistent and is thus a RAM-based filesystem
	that starts empty and contains only the relevant entries.</para>

	<para>The kernel communicates lots of information about any newly added
	device and hands out a pair of major/minor numbers to identify it. With
	this <command>udevd</command> can create the special file under the
	name and with the permissions that it wants. It can also create aliases
	and do additional actions (initialization or registration tasks for
	example). <command>udevd</command>'s behavior is driven by a
	large set of (customizable) rules.</para>

	<para>With dynamically assigned names, you can thus keep the same name
	for a given device, regardless of the connector used or the connection order, which is
	especially useful when you use various USB peripherals. The
	first partition on the first hard drive can then be called
	<filename>/dev/sda1</filename> for backwards compatibility, or
	<filename>/dev/root-partition</filename> if you prefer, or even
	both at the same time since <command>udevd</command> can be
	configured to automatically create a symbolic link.</para>

	<para>Previously, some kernel modules did automatically load
	when you tried to access the corresponding device file; henceforth,
	the peripheral's special file no longer exists prior to loading the
	module, which is no big deal, since most modules are loaded on boot
	thanks to automatic hardware detection. But for undetectable
	peripherals (such as older disk drives or PS/2 mice), this doesn't
	work. Consider adding the modules, <literal>floppy</literal>,
	<literal>psmouse</literal> and <literal>mousedev</literal> to
	<filename>/etc/modules</filename> in order to force loading them on
	boot.</para>

      <para>Configuration of the bootloader must identify the different
      hard drives and their partitions. Linux uses “block” special files
      stored in the <filename>/dev/</filename> directory,
      for this purpose. Historically, <filename>/dev/hda</filename> was the
      master disk on the first IDE controller, and
      <filename>/dev/hdb</filename> its first slave,
      <filename>/dev/hdc</filename> and <filename>/dev/hdd</filename>
      being, respectively, the master and slave disks on the second IDE
      controller, and so on down for any others.
      <filename>/dev/sda</filename> corresponded to the first SCSI drive,
      <filename>/dev/sdb</filename> being the second, etc. Since Debian
      <emphasis role="distribution">Squeeze</emphasis>, this naming scheme
      has been unified by the Linux kernel, and
      all hard drives (IDE/PATA, SATA, SCSI, USB, IEEE 1394) are now
      represented by <filename>/dev/sd*</filename>.</para>

      <para>Each partition is represented by its number on the disk on
      which it resides: for instance, <filename>/dev/sda1</filename> is the
      first partition on the first disk, and <filename>/dev/sdb3</filename>
      is the third partition on the second disk.</para>

      <para>The PC architecture (or “i386”) is limited to four
      “primary” partitions per disk. To go beyond this limitation, one
      of them must be created as an “extended” partition, and it can
      then contain additional “secondary” partitions. These secondary
      partitions must be numbered from 5. Thus the first secondary
      partition could be <filename>/dev/sda5</filename>, followed by
      <filename>/dev/sda6</filename>, etc.</para>

      <para>It is not always easy to remember what disk is connected to
      which SATA controller, or in third position in the SCSI chain,
      especially since the naming of hotplugged hard drives (which includes
      among others most SATA disks and external disks) can change from one
      boot to another. Fortunately, <command>udev</command> creates, in
      addition to <filename>/dev/sd*</filename>, symbolic links with a
      fixed name, which you could then use if you wished to identify a hard
      drive in a non-ambiguous manner. These symbolic links are stored in
      <filename>/dev/disk/by-id</filename>. On a machine with two physical
      disks, for example, one could find the following:</para>

        <title><emphasis>NOTE</emphasis> System clock, hardware clock</title>

	<para>There are two time sources in a computer. A computer's
	motherboard has a hardware clock, called the “CMOS clock”. This
	clock is not very precise, and provides rather slow access times.
	The operating system kernel has its own, the software clock, which
	it keeps up to date with its own means (possibly with the help of
	time servers, see the “Time Synchronization” section). This
	system clock is generally more accurate, especially since it
	doesn't need access to hardware variables. However, since it only
	exists in live memory, it is zeroed out every time the machine is
	booted, contrary to the CMOS clock, which has a battery and
	therefore “survives” rebooting or halting of the machine. The
	system clock is, thus, set from the CMOS clock during boot, and the
	CMOS clock is updated on shutdown (to take into account possible
	changes or corrections if it has been improperly adjusted).</para>

	<para>In practice, there is a problem, since the CMOS clock is
	nothing more than a counter and contains no information regarding
	the time zone. There is a choice to make regarding its
	interpretation: either the system considers it runs in universal
	time (UTC, formerly GMT), or in local time. This choice could be a
	simple shift, but things are actually more complicated: as a result
	of daylight saving time, this offset is not constant. The result is
	that the system has no way to determine whether the offset is
	correct, especially around periods of time change. Since it is
	always possible to reconstruct local time from universal time and
	the timezone information, we strongly recommend using the CMOS
	clock in universal time.</para>

	<para>Unfortunately, Windows systems in their default configuration
	ignore this recommendation; they keep the CMOS clock on local time,
	applying time changes when booting the computer by trying to guess
	during time changes if the change has already been applied or not.
	This works relatively well, as long as the system has only Windows
	running on it. But when a computer has several systems (whether it
	be a “dual-boot” configuration or running other systems via
	virtual machine), chaos ensues, with no means to determine if the
	time is correct. If you absolutely must retain Windows on a
	computer, you should either configure it to keep the CMOS clock as
	UTC (setting the registry key
	<literal>HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\TimeZoneInformation\RealTimeIsUniversal</literal>
	to “1” as a DWORD), or use <command>hwclock --localtime --set</command>
	on the Debian system to set the hardware clock and mark it as tracking
	the local time (and make sure to manually check your clock in spring and
	autumn).</para>

      <para>Time synchronization, which may seem superfluous on a computer,
      is very important on a network. Since users do not have permissions
      allowing them to modify the date and time, it is important for this
      information to be precise to prevent confusion. Furthermore, having
      all of the computers on a network synchronized allows better
      cross-referencing of information from logs on different machines.
      Thus, in the event of an attack, it is easier to reconstruct the
      chronological sequence of actions on the various machines involved in
      the compromise. Data collected on several machines for statistical
      purposes won't make a great deal of sense if they are not

	possible offsets.</para>

	<para>While there are numerous NTP servers on the Internet, the

	for the United States, or <emphasis>ca.pool.ntp.org</emphasis> for
	Canada, etc.</para>

	<para>However, if you manage a large network, it is recommended
	that you install your own NTP server, which will synchronize with
	the public servers. In this case, all the other machines on your
	network can use your internal NTP server instead of increasing the
	load on the public servers. You will also increase homogeneity with

        <title><emphasis>BACK TO BASICS</emphasis> Mounting and unmounting</title>

	<para>In a Unix-like system such as Debian, files are organized in
	a single tree-like hierarchy of directories. The
	<filename>/</filename> directory is called the “root
	directory”; all additional directories are sub-directories within
	this root. “Mounting” is the action of including the content of
	a peripheral device (often a hard drive) into the system's general
	file tree. As a consequence, if you use a separate hard drive to
	store users' personal data, this disk will have to be “mounted”
	in the <filename>/home/</filename> directory. The root filesystem
	is always mounted at boot by the kernel; other devices are often
	mounted later during the startup sequence or manually with the
	<command>mount</command> command.</para>
        <indexterm><primary><command>mount</command></primary></indexterm>

	<para>Some removable devices are automatically mounted when
	connected, especially when using the GNOME, KDE or other graphical
	desktop environments. Others have to be mounted manually by the
	user. Likewise, they must be unmounted (removed from the file
	tree). Normal users do not usually have permission to execute the
	<command>mount</command> and <command>umount</command> commands.
	The administrator can, however, authorize these operations
	(independently for each mount point) by including the
	<literal>user</literal> option in the
	<filename>/etc/fstab</filename> file.</para>

	<para>The <command>mount</command> command can be used without
	arguments (it then lists all mounted filesystems). The following
	parameters are required to mount or unmount a device. For the
	complete list, please refer to the corresponding man pages,
	<citerefentry><refentrytitle>mount</refentrytitle>
	<manvolnum>8</manvolnum></citerefentry> and
	<citerefentry><refentrytitle>umount</refentrytitle>
	<manvolnum>8</manvolnum></citerefentry>. For simple cases, the
	syntax is simple too: for example, to mount the
	<filename>/dev/sdc1</filename> partition, which has an ext3
	filesystem, into the <filename>/mnt/tmp/</filename> directory, you
	would simply run <command>mount -t ext3 /dev/sdc1
	/mnt/tmp/</command>.</para>

      <para>The <filename>/etc/fstab</filename> file gives a list of all

    <para>The kernels provided by Debian include the largest possible
    number of features, as well as the maximum of drivers, in order to
    cover the broadest spectrum of existing hardware configurations. This
    is why some users prefer to recompile the kernel in order to only
    include what they specifically need. There are two reasons for this
    choice. First, it may be to optimize memory consumption, since the
    kernel code, even if it is never used, occupies memory for nothing (and
    never “goes down” on the swap space, since it is actual RAM that it
    uses), which can decrease overall system performance. A locally
    compiled kernel can also limit the risk of security problems since only
    a fraction of the kernel code is compiled and run.</para>

      the control of the packaging system, it can then be removed cleanly,

      command lists the various kernel versions packaged by Debian. The

      retrieve them without much risk (especially if your APT is configured
      according to the instructions of <xref
      linkend="sect.apt-mix-distros"/>). Note that the source code
      contained in these packages does not correspond precisely with that
      published by Linus Torvalds and the kernel developers; like all
      distributions, Debian applies a number of patches, which might (or
      might not) find their way into the upstream version of Linux. These
      modifications include backports of fixes/features/drivers from newer

      Linux tree, and sometimes even Debian specific changes.</para>

      <para>The remainder of this section focuses on the 3.2 version of
      the Linux kernel, but the examples can, of course, be adapted to the
      particular version of the kernel that you want.</para>

      <para>We assume the <emphasis

      It contains
      <filename>/usr/src/linux-source-3.2.tar.bz2</filename>, a
      compressed archive of the kernel sources. You must extract these
      files in a new directory (not directly under

      by calling the <command>make
      <replaceable>target</replaceable></command> command, where
      <replaceable>target</replaceable> is one of the values described
      below.</para>

      <para><command>make menuconfig</command> compiles and executes a
      text-mode interface (this is where the <emphasis
      role="pkg">libncurses5-dev</emphasis> package is required) which
      allows navigating the options available in a hierarchical structure.
      Pressing the <keycap>Space</keycap> key changes the value of the
      selected option, and <keycap>Enter</keycap> validates the button
      selected at the bottom of the screen; <guibutton>Select</guibutton>
      returns to the selected sub-menu; <guibutton>Exit</guibutton> closes
      the current screen and move back up in the hierarchy;
      <guibutton>Help</guibutton> will display more detailed information on
      the role of the selected option. The arrow keys allow moving within the
      list of options and buttons. To exit the configuration program,
      choose <guibutton>Exit</guibutton> from the main menu. The program
      then offers to save the changes you've made; accept if you are
      satisfied with your choices.</para>

      <para>Other interfaces have similar features, but they work within
      more modern graphical interfaces; such as <command>make
      xconfig</command> which uses a Qt graphical interface, and
      <command>make gconfig</command> which uses GTK+. The former requires
      <emphasis role="pkg">libqt4-dev</emphasis>, while the latter
      depends on <emphasis role="pkg">libglade2-dev</emphasis> and
      <emphasis role="pkg">libgtk2.0-dev</emphasis>.</para>

      <para>When using one of those configuration interfaces, it's always
      a good idea to start from a reasonable default configuration. The
      kernel provides such configurations in
      <filename>arch/<replaceable>arch</replaceable>/configs/*_defconfig</filename>
      and you can put your selected configuration in place with a command
      like <command>make x86_84_defconfig</command> (in the case of a
      64-bit PC) or <command>make i386_defconfig</command> (in the case of
      a 32-bit PC).</para>

        <title><emphasis>TIP</emphasis> Dealing with outdated <filename>.config</filename> files</title>

	<para>When you provide a <filename>.config</filename> file that has been
	generated with another (usually older) kernel version, you will have to
	update it. You can do so with <command>make oldconfig</command>, it will
	interactively ask you the questions corresponding to the new
	configuration options. If you want to use the default answer to
	all those questions you can use <command>make
	olddefconfig</command>. With <command>make oldnoconfig</command>,
	it will assume a negative answer to all questions.</para>

      <para>Some modules are maintained outside of the official Linux
      kernel. To use them, they must be compiled alongside the matching
      kernel. A number of common third party modules are provided by Debian
      in dedicated packages, such as <emphasis
      role="pkg">virtualbox-source</emphasis> (kernel support for the VirtualBox
      virtualization solution) or <emphasis role="pkg">oss4-source</emphasis> (Open
      Sound System, some alternative audio drivers).</para>

      <para>These external packages are many and varied and we won't list
      them all here; the <command>apt-cache search source$</command>
      command can narrow down the search field. However, a complete list
      isn't particularly useful since there is no particular reason for
      compiling external modules except when you know you need it. In such
      cases, the device's documentation will typically detail the specific
      module(s) it needs to function under Linux.</para>

      <para>For example, let's look at the <emphasis
      role="pkg">virtualbox-source</emphasis> package: after installation, a
      <filename>.tar.bz2</filename> of the module's sources is stored in
      <filename>/usr/src/</filename>. While we could manually extract
      the tarball and build the module, in practice we prefer to automate
      all this using DKMS. Most modules offer the required DKMS integration
      in a package ending with a <literal>-dkms</literal> suffix. In our case,
      installing <emphasis role="pkg">virtualbox-dkms</emphasis> is all that is
      needed to compile the kernel module for the current kernel provided that
      we have the <emphasis role="pkg">linux-headers-*</emphasis> package
      matching the installed kernel. For instance, if you use
      <emphasis role="pkg">linux-images-amd64</emphasis>, you would
      also install <emphasis role="pkg">linux-headers-amd64</emphasis>.</para>

      <para>Some features are not included in the standard kernel due to a
      lack of maturity or to some disagreement with the kernel maintainers.
      Such features may be distributed as patches that anyone is then free
      to apply to the kernel sources.</para>

      <para>Debian distributes some of these patches in <emphasis
      role="pkg">linux-patch-*</emphasis> or <emphasis
      role="pkg">kernel-patch-*</emphasis> packages (for instance,
      <emphasis role="pkg">linux-patch-grsecurity2</emphasis>, which
      tightens some of the kernel's security policies). These packages
      install files in the <filename>/usr/src/kernel-patches/</filename>
      directory.</para>

      <para>To apply one or more of these installed patches, use the
      <command>patch</command> command in the sources directory then start
      compilation of the kernel as described above.</para>

      <para>Note that a given patch may not necessarily work with every

      refer to the documentation available in the Debian package of the
      patch (in the <filename>/usr/share/doc/linux-patch-*/</filename>

      <para>A Debian kernel package installs the kernel image
      (<filename>vmlinuz-<replaceable>version</replaceable></filename>),
      its configuration
      (<filename>config-<replaceable>version</replaceable></filename>) and
      its symbols table
      (<filename>System.map-<replaceable>version</replaceable></filename>)
      in <filename>/boot/</filename>. The symbols table helps
      developers understand the meaning of a kernel error message; without
      it, kernel “oopses” (an “oops” is the kernel equivalent
      of a segmentation fault for user space programs, in other
      words messages generated following an invalid pointer dereference)
      only contain numeric memory addresses, which is useless information
      without the table mapping these addresses to symbols and function
      names. The modules are installed in the
      <filename>/lib/modules/<replaceable>version</replaceable>/</filename>
      directory.</para>

      <para>The package's configuration scripts automatically generate an
      initrd image, which is a mini-system designed to be loaded in memory
      (hence the name, which stands for “init ramdisk”) by the
      bootloader, and used by the Linux kernel solely for loading the
      modules needed to access the devices containing the complete Debian
      system (for example, the driver for IDE disks). Finally, the
      post-installation scripts update the symbolic links
      <filename>/vmlinuz</filename>, <filename>/vmlinuz.old</filename>,
      <filename>/initrd.img</filename> and
      <filename>/initrd.img.old</filename> so that they point to the latest
      two kernels installed, respectively, as well as the corresponding
      initrd images.</para>

      <para>Most of those tasks are offloaded to hook scripts in
      the <filename>/etc/kernel/*.d/</filename> directories. For instance,
      the integration with <command>grub</command> relies on
      <filename>/etc/kernel/postinst.d/zz-update-grub</filename>
      and <filename>/etc/kernel/postrm.d/zz-update-grub</filename>
      to call <command>update-grub</command> when kernels
      are installed or removed.</para>

      <para>Using <command>apt-get</command> is so convenient that it makes
      it easy to forget about the lower-level tools, but the easiest way of
      installing a compiled kernel is to use a command such as
      <command>dpkg -i <replaceable>package</replaceable>.deb</command>,
      where <literal><replaceable>package</replaceable>.deb</literal> is

      <para>The configuration steps described in this chapter are basic and
      can lead both to a server system or a workstation, and it can be
      massively duplicated in semi-automated ways. However, it is not
      enough by itself to provide a fully configured system. A few pieces
      are still in need of configuration, starting with low-level programs
      known as the “Unix services”.</para>
