  <title>Unix Services</title>
  <highlights>
    <para>This chapter covers a number of basic services that are common to
    many Unix systems. All administrators should be familiar with
    them.</para>

    <title>System Boot</title>
    <indexterm><primary>booting</primary><secondary>the system</secondary></indexterm>

    <para>When you boot the computer, the many messages scrolling by on the
    console display many automatic initializations and configurations that
    are being executed. Sometimes you may wish to slightly alter how this
    stage works, which means that you need to understand it well. That is
    the purpose of this section.</para>

    <para>First, the BIOS takes control of the computer, detects the disks,
    loads the <emphasis>Master Boot Record</emphasis>, and executes the
    bootloader. The bootloader takes over, finds the kernel on the disk,
    loads and executes it. The kernel is then initialized, and starts to
    search for and mount the partition containing the root filesystem, and
    finally executes the first program — <command>init</command>.
    Frequently, this “root partition” and this <command>init</command>
    are, in fact, located in a virtual filesystem that only exists in RAM
    (hence its name, “initramfs”, formerly called “initrd” for
    “initialization RAM disk”). This filesystem is loaded in memory by
    the bootloader, often from a file on a hard drive or from the network.
    It contains the bare minimum required by the kernel to load the
    “true” root filesystem: this may be driver modules for the hard
    drive, or other devices without which the system can not boot, or, more
    frequently, initialization scripts and modules for assembling RAID
    arrays, opening encrypted partitions, activating LVM volumes, etc. Once
    the root partition is mounted, the initramfs hands over control to the
    real init, and the machine goes back to the standard boot
    process.</para>

    <sidebar>
      <title><emphasis>SPECIFIC CASE</emphasis> Booting from the network</title>

      <para>In some configurations, the BIOS may be configured not to
      execute the MBR, but to seek its equivalent on the network, making it
      possible to build computers without a hard drive, or which are
      completely reinstalled on each boot. This option is not available on
      all hardware and it generally requires an appropriate combination of
      BIOS and network card.</para>

      <para>Booting from the network can be used to launch the
      <command>debian-installer</command> or FAI (see <xref
      linkend="sect.installation-methods"/>).</para>
    </sidebar>

    <sidebar>
      <title><emphasis>BACK TO BASICS</emphasis> The process, a program instance</title>
      <indexterm><primary>process</primary></indexterm>

      <para>A process is the representation in memory of a running program.
      It includes all of the information necessary for the proper execution
      of the software (the code itself, but also the data that it has in
      memory, the list of files that it has opened, the network connections
      it has established, etc.). A single program may be instantiated into
      several processes, not necessarily running under different user
      IDs.</para>
    </sidebar>

    <para>Init executes several processes, following instructions from the
    <filename>/etc/inittab</filename> file. The first program that is
    executed (which corresponds to the <emphasis>sysinit</emphasis> step)
    is <command>/etc/init.d/rcS</command>, a script that executes all of
    the programs in the <filename>/etc/rcS.d/</filename> directory.

      <title><emphasis>SECURITY</emphasis> Using a shell as <command>init</command> to gain root rights</title>

      <para>By convention, the first process that is booted is the
      <command>init</command> program. However, it is possible to pass an
      <literal>init</literal> option to the kernel indicating a different
      program.</para>
      <indexterm><primary><command>init</command></primary></indexterm>

      <para>Any person who is able to access the computer can press the
      <keycap>Reset</keycap> button, and thus reboot it. Then, at the
      bootloader's prompt, it is possible to pass the
      <literal>init=/bin/sh</literal> option to the kernel to gain root
      access without knowing the administrator's password.</para>

      <para>To prevent this, you can protect the bootloader itself with a
      password. You might also think about protecting access to the BIOS (a
      password protection mechanism is almost always available), without
      which a malicious intruder could still boot the machine on a
      removable media containing its own Linux system, which they could
      then use to access data on the computer's hard drives.</para>

      <para>Finally, be aware that most BIOS have a generic password
      available. Initially intended for troubleshooting for those who have
      forgotten their password, these passwords are now public and
      available on the Internet (see for yourself by searching for
      “generic BIOS passwords” in a search engine). All of these
      protections will thus impede unauthorized access to the machine
      without being able to completely prevent it. There's no reliable way
      to protect a computer if the attacker can physically access it; they
      could dismount the hard drives to connect them to a computer under
      their own control anyway, or even steal the entire machine, or erase
      the BIOS memory to reset the password…</para>

    <sidebar>
      <title><emphasis>BACK TO BASICS</emphasis> Kernel modules and options</title>
      <indexterm><primary>modules</primary><secondary>kernel modules</secondary></indexterm>

      <para>Kernel modules also have options that can be configured by
      putting some files in <filename>/etc/modprobe.d/</filename>. These
      options are defined with directives like this: <literal>options
      <replaceable>module-name</replaceable>
      <replaceable>option-name</replaceable>=<replaceable>option-value</replaceable></literal>.
      Several options can be specified with a single directive if
      necessary.</para>

      <para>These configuration files are intended for
      <command>modprobe</command> — the program that loads a kernel
      module with its dependencies (modules can indeed call other modules).
      This program is provided by the <emphasis
      role="pkg">module-init-tools</emphasis> package.</para>
      <indexterm><primary><command>modprobe</command></primary></indexterm>
      <indexterm><primary><emphasis role="pkg">module-init-tools</emphasis></primary></indexterm>
    </sidebar>

    <para>After this stage, <command>init</command> takes over and starts
    the programs enabled in the default runlevel (which is usually runlevel
    2). It executes <command>/etc/init.d/rc 2</command>, a script that
    starts all services which are listed in
    <filename>/etc/rc2.d/</filename> and whose name start with the “S”
    letter. The two-figures number that follows had historically been used
    to define the order in which services had to be started. In <emphasis
    role="distribution">Squeeze</emphasis>, the default boot system uses
    <command>insserv</command>, which schedules everything automatically
    based on the scripts' dependencies. Each boot script thus declares the
    conditions that must be met to start or stop the service (for example,
    if it must start before or after another service);
    <command>init</command> then launches them in the order that meets
    these conditions. The static numbering of scripts is therefore no
    longer taken into consideration (but they must always have a name
    beginning with “S” followed by two digits and the actual name
    of the script used for the dependencies). Generally, base services
    (such as logging with <command>rsyslog</command>, or port assignment
    with <command>portmap</command>) are started first, followed by
    standard services and the graphical interface
    (<command>gdm</command>).</para>

    <para>This dependency-based boot system makes it possible to automate
    re-numbering, which could be rather tedious if it had to be done
    manually, and it limits the risks of human error, since scheduling is
    conducted according to the parameters that are indicated. Another
    benefit is that services can be started in parallel when they are
    independent from one another, which can accelerate the boot
    process.</para>

    <sidebar>
      <title><emphasis>ALTERNATIVE</emphasis> Other boot systems</title>

      <para>This book describes the boot system used by default in Debian
      (as implemented by <emphasis role="pkg">sysvinit</emphasis> package),
      which is derived and inherited from <emphasis>System V</emphasis>
      Unix systems, but there are others.</para>

      <para>In the original <emphasis>System V</emphasis>, and in versions
      of Debian up to <emphasis role="distribution">Lenny</emphasis>, the
      execution order of initialization scripts was defined only by the
      names of the <filename>/etc/rc*.d/S*</filename> symbolic links (and
      <filename>/etc/rc*.d/K*</filename> upon shutdown). This behavior can
      be re-established by setting <literal>CONCURRENCY=none</literal> in
      the <filename>/etc/default/rcS</filename> file.</para>

      <para><emphasis role="pkg">file-rc</emphasis> is another boot system
      with a very simple process. It keeps the principle of runlevels, but
      replaces the directories and symbolic links with a configuration
      file, which indicates to <command>init</command> the processes that
      must be started and their launch order.</para>

      <para>The newly arrived <command>upstart</command> system is still
      not perfectly tested on Debian. It is event based: init scripts are
      no longer executed in a sequential order but in response to events
      such as the completion of another script upon which they are
      dependent. This system, started by Ubuntu, is present in Debian
      <emphasis role="distribution">Squeeze</emphasis>, but is not the
      default; it comes, in fact, as a replacement for <emphasis
      role="pkg">sysvinit</emphasis>, and one of the tasks launched by
      <command>upstart</command> is to launch the scripts written for
      traditional systems, especially those from the <emphasis
      role="pkg">sysv-rc</emphasis> package.</para>

      <para>Another new option is <command>systemd</command>, but it still
      lacks the maturity needed to be part of <emphasis
      role="distribution">Squeeze</emphasis>. Its approach is opposite to
      the previous systems; instead of preemptively launching all services,
      and having to deal with the question of scheduling,
      <command>systemd</command> chooses to start services on demand,
      somewhat along the principle of <command>inetd</command>. But this
      means that the boot system must be able to know how services are made
      available (it could be through a socket, a filesystem, or others),
      and thus requires small modifications of those services.</para>

      <para>There are also other systems and other operating modes, such as
      <command>runit</command>, <command>minit</command>, or
      <command>initng</command>, but they are relatively specialized and
      not widespread.</para>
    </sidebar>
    <indexterm><primary>runlevel</primary></indexterm>
    <indexterm><primary>runlevel</primary></indexterm>
    <indexterm><primary>level, runlevel</primary></indexterm>

    <para><command>init</command> distinguishes several runlevels, so it
    can switch from one to another with the <command>telinit
    <replaceable>new-level</replaceable></command> command. Immediately,
    <command>init</command> executes <command>/etc/init.d/rc</command>
    again with the new runlevel. This script will then start the missing
    services and stop those that are no longer desired. To do this, it
    refers to the content of the
    <filename>/etc/rc<replaceable>X</replaceable>.d</filename> (where
    <replaceable>X</replaceable> represents the new runlevel). Scripts
    starting with “S” (as in “Start”) are services to be started;
    those starting with “K” (as in “Kill”) are the services to be
    stopped. The script does not start any service that was already active
    in the previous runlevel.</para>

    <para>By default, Debian uses four different runlevels:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>Level 0 is only used temporarily, while the computer is
	powering down. As such, it only contains many “K”
	scripts.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>Level 1, also known as single-user mode, corresponds to the
	system in degraded mode; it includes only basic services, and is
	intended for maintenance operations where interactions with
	ordinary users are not desired.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>Level 2 is the level for normal operation, which includes
	networking services, a graphical interface, user logins,
	etc.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>Level 6 is similar to level 0, except that it is used during
	the shutdown phase that precedes a reboot.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>Other levels exist, especially 3 to 5. By default they are
    configured to operate the same way as level 2, but the administrator
    can modify them (by adding or deleting scripts in the corresponding
    <filename>/etc/rc<replaceable>X</replaceable>.d</filename> directories)
    to adapt them to particular needs.</para>

    <para>All the scripts contained in the various
    <filename>/etc/rc<replaceable>X</replaceable>.d</filename> directories
    are really only symbolic links — created upon package installation by
    the <command>update-rc.d</command> program — pointing to the actual
    scripts which are stored in <filename>/etc/init.d/</filename>. The
    administrator can fine tune the services available in each runlevel by
    re-running <command>update-rc.d</command> with adjusted parameters. The
    <citerefentry><refentrytitle>update-rc.d</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry>
    manual page describes the syntax in detail. Please note that removing
    all symbolic links (with the <literal>remove</literal> parameter) is
    not a good method to disable a service. Instead you should simply
    configure it to not start in the desired runlevel (while preserving the
    corresponding calls to stop it in the event that the service runs in
    the previous runlevel). Since <command>update-rc.d</command> has a
    somewhat convoluted interface, you may prefer using
    <command>rcconf</command> (from the <emphasis
    role="pkg">rcconf</emphasis> package) which provides a more
    user-friendly interface.</para>

      <indexterm><primary>service</primary><secondary>restart</secondary></indexterm>
      <indexterm><primary>restarting services</primary></indexterm>

      <para>The maintainer scripts for Debian packages will sometimes
      restart certain services to ensure their availability or get them to
      take certain options into account. The command that controls a
      service — <command>/etc/init.d/<replaceable>service</replaceable>
      <replaceable>operation</replaceable></command> — doesn't take
      runlevel into consideration, assumes (wrongly) that the service is
      currently being used, and may thus initiate incorrect operations
      (starting a service that was deliberately stopped, or stopping a
      service that is already stopped, etc.). Debian therefore introduced
      the <command>invoke-rc.d</command> program: this program must be used
      by maintainer scripts to run services initialization scripts and it
      will only execute the necessary commands. Note that, contrary to
      common usage, the <filename>.d</filename> suffix is used here in a
      program name, and not in a directory.</para>
    </sidebar>

    <para>Finally, <command>init</command> starts control programs for
    various virtual consoles (<command>getty</command>). It displays a
    prompt, waiting for a username, then executes <command>login
    <replaceable>user</replaceable></command> to initiate a session.</para>

    <sidebar>
      <title><emphasis>VOCABULARY</emphasis> Console and terminal</title>

      <para>The first computers were usually separated into several, very
      large parts: the storage enclosure and the central processing unit
      were separate from the peripheral devices used by the operators to
      control them. These were part of a separate furniture, the
      “console”. This term was retained, but its meaning has changed.
      It has become more or less synonymous with “terminal”, being a
      keyboard and a screen.</para>

      <para>With the development of computers, operating systems have
      offered several virtual consoles to allow for several independent
      sessions at the same time, even if there is only one keyboard and
      screen. Most GNU/Linux systems offer six virtual consoles (in text
      mode), accessible by typing the key combinations <keycombo
      action="simul"> <keycap>Control</keycap> <keycap>Alt</keycap>
      <keycap>F1</keycap> </keycombo> through <keycombo action="simul">
      <keycap>Control</keycap> <keycap>Alt</keycap> <keycap>F6</keycap>
      </keycombo>.</para>

      <para>By extension, the terms “console” and “terminal” can
      also refer to a terminal emulator in a graphical X11 session (such as
      <command>xterm</command>, <command>gnome-terminal</command> or
      <command>konsole</command>).</para>

  <section id="sect.remote-login">
    <title id="connexion-distance.title">Remote Login</title>

    <para>It is essential for an administrator to be able to connect to a
    computer remotely. Servers, confined in their own room, are rarely
    equipped with permanent keyboards and monitors — but they are
    connected to the network.</para>

      <para>A system where several processes communicate with each other is
      often described with the “client/server” metaphor. The server is
      the program that takes requests coming from a client and executes

      <para>The <emphasis>telnet</emphasis> protocol, the oldest remote
      login service, is the worst in terms of security. Data and passwords
      are sent in clear text — that is, not encrypted — leaving them
      vulnerable to anyone snooping on the network. If necessary, take care

      default:</para>

      <para>There is, however, an adaptation that corrects its most
      crippling defects; it uses SSL (Secure Socket Layer) to authenticate
      the partner and encrypt communications. The
      <emphasis>telnetd-ssl</emphasis> and <emphasis>telnet-ssl</emphasis>
      packages provide, respectively, the server and client

        <title><emphasis>VOCABULARY</emphasis> Authentication, encryption</title>

	<para>When you need to give a client the ability to conduct or
	trigger actions on a server, security is important. You must ensure
	the identity of the client; this is authentication. This identity
	usually consists of a password that must be kept secret, or any
	other client could get the password. This is the purpose of
	encryption, which is a form of encoding that allows two systems to
	communicate confidential information on a public channel while
	protecting it from being readable to others.</para>

	<para>Authentication and encryption are often mentioned together,
	both because they are frequently used together, and because they
	are usually implemented with similar mathematical concepts.</para>

	<para>A “fork”, in the software field, means a new project that
	starts as a clone of an existing project, and that will compete
	with it. From there on, both software will usually quickly diverge
	in terms of new developments. A fork is often the result of
	disagreements within the development team.</para>

	<para>The option to fork a project is a direct result of the very
	nature of free software; a fork is a healthy event when it enables
	the continuation of a project as free software (for example in case
	of license changes). A fork arising from technical or personal
	disagreements is often a waste of human resources; another
	resolution would be preferable. Mergers of two projects that
	previously went through a prior fork are not unheard of.</para>

      <para>Since <emphasis role="distribution">Etch</emphasis>, OpenSSH is

      the <emphasis role="pkg">openssh-server</emphasis> package. The
      <emphasis role="pkg">ssh</emphasis> meta-package depends on both
      parts and facilitates installation of both (<command>apt-get install

	<para>Some hardware provides native support of mathematical
	functions used by encryption, which can speed up the required
	calculations, thus increasing performance of some tools (and
	lightening the load on the main processor). These tools notably
	include the OpenSSL library, which is in turn used by
	OpenSSH.</para>

	<para>Although a project for standardization of drivers is underway
	(notably at the kernel level), the variety of hardware is still
	managed inequitably and heterogeneously. For example, the Padlock
	system included in Via C3 processors is only partially supported.
	While the Linux kernel does offer various encryption algorithms,
	the OpenSSL 0.9.8 library in <emphasis
	role="distribution">Squeeze</emphasis> only handles delegation of
	AES encryption to the hardware dedicated to that purpose, but not
	the SHA algorithms; you have to recompile it with a patch. <ulink

        <title>Key-Based Authentication</title>

	<para>Each time someone logs in over SSH, the remote server asks
	for a password to authenticate the user. This can be problematic if
	you want to automate a connection, or if you use a tool that
	requires frequent connections over SSH. This is why SSH offers a
	key-based authentication system.</para>

	<para>The user generates a key pair on the client machine with
	<command>ssh-keygen -t rsa</command>; the public key is stored in
	<filename>~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</filename>, while the corresponding
	private key is stored in <filename>~/.ssh/id_rsa</filename>. The
	user then uses <command>ssh-copy-id
	<replaceable>server</replaceable></command> to add their public key
	to the <filename>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</filename> file on the
	server. If the private key was not protected with a
	“passphrase” at the time of its creation, all subsequent logins
	on the server will work without a password. Otherwise, the private
	key must be decrypted each time by entering the passphrase.
	Fortunately, <command>ssh-agent</command> allows us to keep private
	keys in memory to not have to regularly re-enter the password. For
	this, you simply use <command>ssh-add</command> (once per work
	session) provided that the session is already associated with a
	functional instance of <command>ssh-agent</command>. Debian
	activates it by default in graphical sessions, but this can be
	deactivated by changing
	<filename>/etc/X11/Xsession.options</filename>. For a console
	session, you can manually start it with <command>eval
	$(ssh-agent)</command>.</para>

          <title><emphasis>SECURITY</emphasis> Protection of the private key</title>

	  <para>Whoever has the private key can login on the account thus
	  configured. This is why access to the private key is protected by
	  a “passphrase”. Someone who acquires a copy of a private key
	  file (for example, <filename>~/.ssh/id_rsa</filename>) still has
	  to know this phrase in order to be able to use it. This
	  additional protection is not, however, impregnable, and if you
	  think that this file has been compromised, it is best to disable
	  that key on the computers in which it has been installed (by
	  removing it from the <filename>authorized_keys</filename> files)
	  and replacing it with a newly generated key.</para>

          <title><emphasis>CULTURE</emphasis> OpenSSL flaw in Debian <emphasis role="distribution">Etch</emphasis></title>

	  <para>The OpenSSL library, as initially provided in Debian
	  <emphasis role="distribution">Etch</emphasis>, had a serious
	  problem in its random number generator (RNG). Indeed, the Debian
	  maintainer had made a change in order for the library to not be
	  the source of warnings for programs using it and that would be
	  analyzed by memory testing tools like
	  <command>valgrind</command>. Unfortunately, this change also
	  meant that the RNG was employing only one source of entropy
	  corresponding to the process number (PID) whose 32,000 possible
	  values do not offer enough randomness. <ulink type="block"
	  url="http://www.debian.org/security/2008/dsa-1571"/></para>

	  <para>Specifically, whenever OpenSSL was used to generate a key,
	  it always produced a key within a known set of hundreds of
	  thousands of keys (32,000 multiplied by a small number of key
	  lengths). This affected SSH keys, SSL keys, and X.509
	  certificates used by numerous applications, such as OpenVPN. A
	  cracker had only to try all of the keys to gain unauthorized
	  access. To reduce the impact of the problem, the SSH daemon was
	  modified to refuse problematic keys that are listed in the
	  <emphasis role="pkg">openssh-blacklist</emphasis> and <emphasis
	  role="pkg">openssh-blacklist-extra</emphasis> packages.
	  Additionally, the <command>ssh-vulnkey</command> command allows
	  identification of possibly compromised keys in the system.</para>

	  <para>A more thorough analysis of this incident brings to light
	  that it is the result of multiple (small) problems, both at the
	  OpenSSL project, as well as with the Debian package maintainer. A
	  widely used library like OpenSSL should — without modifications
	  — not generate warnings when tested by
	  <command>valgrind</command>. Furthermore, the code (especially
	  the parts as sensitive as the RNG) should be better commented to
	  prevent such errors. The Debian maintainer, for his part, wanting
	  to validate his modifications with the OpenSSL developers, simply
	  explained his modifications without providing them the
	  corresponding patch to review. He also did not clearly identify
	  himself as the maintainer of the corresponding Debian package.
	  Finally, in his maintenance choices, the maintainer did not
	  clearly document the changes made to the original code; all the
	  modifications are effectively stored in a Subversion repository,
	  but they ended up all lumped into one single patch during
	  creation of the source package.</para>

	  <para>It is difficult under such conditions to find the
	  corrective measures to prevent such incidents from recurring. The
	  lesson to be learned here is that every divergence Debian
	  introduces to upstream software must be justified, documented,
	  submitted to the upstream project when possible, and widely
	  publicized. It is from this perspective that the new source
	  package format (“3.0 (quilt)”) and the Debian patch tracker
	  were developed. <ulink type="block"

	  <para>The Internet, and most LANs that are connected to it,
	  operate in packet mode and not in connected mode, meaning that a

	  at several intermediary routers to find its way to its
	  destination. You can still simulate a connected operation where
	  the stream is encapsulated in normal IP packets. These packets
	  follow their usual route, but the stream is reconstructed

	  analogous to a road tunnel in which vehicles drive directly from
	  the entrance (input) to the exit (output) without encountering
	  any intersections, as opposed to a path on the surface that would
	  involve intersections and changing direction.</para>

	  <para>You can use this opportunity to add encryption to the

	<para><command>ssh -L 8000:server:25 intermediary</command>

	<para><command>ssh -R 8000:server:25 intermediary</command> also

	<para>In both cases, connections are made to port 25 on the

	<para>If you want to connect by VNC, and you don't want your data
	sent in clear text on the network, it is possible to encapsulate
	the data in an SSH tunnel (see <xref
	linkend="sect.ssh-port-forwarding"/>). You simply have to know
	that VNC uses port 5900 by default for the first screen (called
	“localhost:0”), 5901 for the second (called “localhost:1”),
	etc.</para>

	<para>The <command>ssh -L localhost:5901:localhost:5900 -N -T
	<replaceable>machine</replaceable></command> command creates a
	tunnel between local port 5901 in the localhost interface and port
	5900 of the <replaceable>machine</replaceable> host. The first
	“localhost” restricts SSH to listening to only that interface
	on the local machine. The second “localhost” indicates the
	interface on the remote machine which will receive the network
	traffic entering in “localhost:5901”. Thus <command>vncviewer
	localhost:1</command> will connect the VNC client to the remote
	screen, even though you indicate the name of the local
	machine.</para>

      <para>VNC also works for mobile users, or company executives, who
      occasionally need to login from their home to access a remote desktop
      similar to the one they use at work. The configuration of such a
      service is more complicated: you first install the <emphasis

      the display manager to accept <literal>XDMCP Query</literal> requests
      (for <command>gdm</command>, this can be done graphically via the

      <emphasis role="distribution">Squeeze</emphasis>), and finally, start
      the VNC server with <command>inetd</command> so that a session is

      <para>Redirecting incoming connections to the display manager solves
      the problem of authentication, because only users with local accounts
      will pass the <command>gdm</command> login screen (or equivalent
      <command>kdm</command>, <command>xdm</command>, etc.). As this
      operation allows multiple simultaneous logins without any problem
      (provided the server is powerful enough), it can even be used to
      provide complete desktops for mobile users (or for less powerful
      desktop systems, configured as thin clients). Users simply login to
      the server's screen with <command>vncviewer
      <replaceable>server</replaceable>:50</command>, because the port used

    <sidebar>
      <title><emphasis>SECURITY</emphasis> <literal>setuid</literal> and <literal>setgid</literal> executables</title>

      <para>Two particular rights are relevant to executable files:
      <literal>setuid</literal> and <literal>setgid</literal> (symbolized
      with the letter “s”). Note that we frequently speak of “bit”,
      since each of these boolean values can be represented by a 0 or a 1.
      These two rights allow any user to execute the program with the
      rights of the owner or the group, respectively. This mechanism grants
      access to features requiring higher level permissions than those you

      then impersonate the root user and have all rights on the

    <para>A directory is handled differently. Read access gives the right
    to consult the list of its entries (files and directories), write
    access allows creating or deleting files, and execute access allows
    crossing through it (especially to go there with the

      <para>The “sticky” bit (symbolized by the letter “t”) is a
      permission that is only useful in directories. It is especially used

      <filename>/tmp/</filename>): it restricts deletion of files so that
      only their owner (or the owner of the parent directory) can do it.
      Lacking this, everyone could delete other users' files in
      <filename>/tmp/</filename>.</para>
    </sidebar>

    <para>Three commands control the permissions associated with a
    file:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para><command>chown <replaceable>user</replaceable>
	<replaceable>file</replaceable></command> changes the owner of the
	file;</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para><command>chgrp <replaceable>group</replaceable>
	<replaceable>file</replaceable></command> alters the owner
	group;</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para><command>chmod <replaceable>rights</replaceable>
	<replaceable>file</replaceable></command> changes the permissions
	for the file.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>There are two ways of presenting rights. Among them, the symbolic
    representation is probably the easiest to understand and remember. It
    involves the letter symbols mentioned above. You can define rights for
    each category of users
    (<literal>u</literal>/<literal>g</literal>/<literal>o</literal>), by
    setting them explicitly (with <literal>=</literal>), by adding
    (<literal>+</literal>), or subtracting (<literal>-</literal>). Thus the
    <literal>u=rwx,g+rw,o-r</literal> formula gives the owner read, write,
    and execute rights, adds read and write rights for the owner group, and
    removes read rights for other users. Rights not altered by the addition
    or subtraction in such a command remain unmodified. The letter
    <literal>a</literal>, for “all”, covers all three categories of
    users, so that <literal>a=rx</literal> grants all three categories the
    same rights (read and execute, but not write).</para>
    <indexterm><primary><command>chmod</command></primary></indexterm>
    <indexterm><primary><command>chown</command></primary></indexterm>
    <indexterm><primary><command>chgrp</command></primary></indexterm>
    <indexterm><primary>octal representation of rights</primary></indexterm>
    <indexterm><primary>rights, octal representation</primary></indexterm>
    <indexterm><primary>rights, octal representation</primary></indexterm>

    <para>The (octal) numeric representation associates each right with a
    value: 4 for read, 2 for write, and 1 for execute. We associate each
    combination of rights with the sum of the figures. Each value is then
    assigned to different categories of users by putting them end to end in
    the usual order (owner, group, others).</para>

    <para>For instance, the <command>chmod 754
    <replaceable>file</replaceable></command> command will set the
    following rights: read, write and execute for the owner (since 7 = 4 +
    2 + 1); read and execute for the group (since 5 = 4 + 1); read-only for
    others. The <literal>0</literal> means no rights; thus <command>chmod
    600 <replaceable>file</replaceable></command> allows for read/write
    rights for the owner, and no rights for anyone else. The most frequent
    right combinations are <literal>755</literal> for executable files and
    directories, and <literal>644</literal> for data files.</para>

    <para>To represent special rights, you can prefix a fourth digit to
    this number according to the same principle, where the
    <literal>setuid</literal>, <literal>setgid</literal> and
    <literal>sticky</literal> bits are 4, 2 and 1, respectively.
    <command>chmod 4754</command> will associate the
    <literal>setuid</literal> bit with the previously described
    rights.</para>

    <para>Note that the use of octal notation only allows to set all the
    rights at once on a file; you can not use it to simply add a new right,
    such as read access for the group owner, since you must take into
    account the existing rights and compute the new corresponding numerical
    value.</para>

    <sidebar>
      <title><emphasis>TIP</emphasis> Recursive operation</title>

      <para>Sometimes we have to change rights for an entire file tree. All
      the commands above have a <literal>-R</literal> option to operate
      recursively in sub-directories.</para>

      <para>The distinction between directories and files sometimes causes
      problems with recursive operations. That's why the “X” letter has
      been introduced in the symbolic representation of rights. It
      represents a right to execute which applies only to directories (and
      not to files lacking this right). Thus, <command>chmod -R a+X
      <replaceable>directory</replaceable></command> will only add execute
      rights for all categories of users (<literal>a</literal>) for all of
      the sub-directories and files for which at least one category of user
      (even if their sole owner) already has execute rights.</para>
    </sidebar>

    <sidebar>
      <title><emphasis>TIP</emphasis> Changing the user and group</title>

      <para>Frequently you want to change the group of a file at the same
      time that you change the owner. The <command>chown</command> command
      has a special syntax for that: <command>chown
      <replaceable>user</replaceable>:<replaceable>group</replaceable></command></para>
    </sidebar>

    <sidebar>
      <title><emphasis>GOING FURTHER</emphasis> <command>umask</command></title>

      <para>When an application creates a file, it assigns indicative
      permissions, knowing that the system automatically removes certain
      rights, given by the command <command>umask</command>. Enter
      <command>umask</command> in a shell; you will see a mask such as
      <computeroutput>0022</computeroutput>. This is simply an octal
      representation of the rights to be systematically removed (in this
      case, the write right for the group and other users).</para>
      <indexterm><primary>umask</primary></indexterm>
      <indexterm><primary>rights</primary><secondary>mask</secondary></indexterm>
      <indexterm><primary>mask</primary><secondary>rights mask</secondary></indexterm>

      <para>If you give it a new octal value, the <command>umask</command>
      command modifies the mask. Used in a shell initialization file (for
      example, <filename>~/.bash_profile</filename>), it will effectively
      change the default mask for your work sessions.</para>

    <para>Using a graphical interface for administration is interesting in
    various circumstances. An administrator does not necessarily know all
    the configuration details for all their services, and doesn't always
    have the time to go seeking out the documentation on the matter. A
    graphical interface for administration can thus accelerate the
    deployment of a new service. It can also simplify the setup of services
    which are hard to configure.</para>

    <para>Such an interface is only an aid, and not an end in itself. In
    all cases, the administrator must master its behavior in order to
    understand and work around any potential problem.</para>

    <para>Since no interface is perfect, you may be tempted to try several
    solutions. This is to be avoided as much as possible, since different
    tools are sometimes incompatible in their work methods. Even if they
    all target to be very flexible and try to adopt the configuration file
    as a single reference, they are not always able to integrate external
    changes.</para>

      that reconfiguration of the package only impacts the enclosed area.
      In other cases, reconfiguration will not change anything if the
      script detects a manual modification of the configuration file, in

	<para>The Debian Policy expressly stipulates that everything should
	be done to preserve manual changes made to a configuration file, so
	more and more scripts take precautions when editing configuration
	files. The general principle is simple: the script will only make
	changes if it knows the status of the configuration file, which is
	verified by comparing the checksum of the file against that of the
	last automatically generated file. If they are the same, the script
	is authorized to change the configuration file. Otherwise, it
	determines that the file has been changed and asks what action it
	should take (install the new file, save the old file, or try to
	integrate the new changes with the existing file). This
	precautionary principle has long been unique to Debian, but other
	distributions have gradually begun to embrace it.</para>

      The overall principle is to write “selector” and “action”

      describes how to deal with them.</para>
      <section id="sect.syslog-syntaxe-selecteur">
        <title>Syntax of the Selector</title>

	<para>The selector is a semicolon-separated list of
	<literal><replaceable>subsystem</replaceable>.<replaceable>priority</replaceable></literal>
	pairs (example: <literal>auth.notice;mail.info</literal>). An
	asterisk may represent all subsystems or all priorities (examples:
	<literal>*.alert</literal> or <literal>mail.*</literal>). Several
	subsystems can be grouped, by separating them with a comma
	(example: <literal>auth,mail.info</literal>). The priority
	indicated also covers messages of equal or higher priority; thus
	<literal>auth.alert</literal> indicates the <literal>auth</literal>
	subsystem messages of <literal>alert</literal> or
	<literal>emerg</literal> priority. Prefixed with an exclamation
	point (!), it indicates the opposite, in other words the strictly
	lower priorities; <literal>auth.!notice</literal>, thus, indicates
	messages issued from <literal>auth</literal>, with
	<literal>info</literal> or <literal>debug</literal> priority.
	Prefixed with an equal sign (=), it corresponds to precisely and
	only the priority indicated (<literal>auth.=notice</literal> only
	concerns messages from <literal>auth</literal> with
	<literal>notice</literal> priority).</para>

	<para>Each element in the list on the selector overrides previous
	elements. It is thus possible to restrict a set or to exclude
	certain elements from it. For example,
	<literal>kern.info;kern.!err</literal> means messages from the
	kernel with priority between <literal>info</literal> and
	<literal>warn</literal>. The <literal>none</literal> priority
	indicates the empty set (no priorities), and may serve to exclude a
	subsystem from a set of messages. Thus,
	<literal>*.crit;kern.none</literal> indicates all the messages of
	priority equal to or higher than <literal>crit</literal> not coming
	from the kernel.</para>

	  <para>It is a good idea to record the most important logs on a
	  separate machine (perhaps dedicated for this purpose), since this
	  will prevent any possible intruder from removing traces of their
	  intrusion (unless, of course, they also compromise this other
	  server). Furthermore, in the event of a major problem (such as a
	  kernel crash), you have the logs available on another machine,
	  which increases your chances of determining the sequence of
	  events that caused the crash.</para>

	  <para>To accept log messages sent by other machines, you must
	  reconfigure <emphasis>rsyslog</emphasis>: in practice, it is

    <title>The <command>inetd</command> Super-Server</title>

    <para>Inetd (often called “Internet super-server”) is a server of

    <indexterm><primary><command>inetd</command></primary></indexterm>
    <indexterm><primary>super-server</primary></indexterm>

    <para>The <filename>/etc/inetd.conf</filename> file lists these servers

      <title><emphasis>DEBIAN POLICY</emphasis> Register a server in <filename>inetd.conf</filename></title>

      <para>Packages frequently want to register a new server in the
      <filename>/etc/inetd.conf</filename> file, but Debian Policy
      prohibits any package from modifying a configuration file that it
      doesn't own. This is why the <command>updated-inetd</command> script
      (in the package with the same name) was created: It manages the
      configuration file, and other packages can thus use it to register a
      new server to the super-server's configuration.</para>
    </sidebar>

    <para>Each significant line of the <filename>/etc/inetd.conf</filename>

	<para>In Debian, <command>cron</command> takes the time change (for
	Daylight Savings Time, or in fact for any significant change in the
	local time) into account as best as it can. Thus, the commands that
	should have been executed during an hour that never existed (for
	example, tasks scheduled at 2:30 am during the Spring time change
	in France, since at 2:00 am the clock jumps directly to 3:00 am)
	are executed shortly after the time change (thus around 3:00 am
	DST). On the other hand, in autumn, when commands would be executed
	several times (2:30 am DST, then an hour later at 2:30 am standard
	time, since at 3:00 am DST the clock turns back to 2:00 am) are
	only executed once.</para>

	<para>Be careful, however, if the order in which the different
	scheduled tasks and the delay between their respective executions
	matters, you should check the compatibility of these constraints
	with <command>cron</command>'s behavior; if necessary, you can
	prepare a special schedule for the two problematic nights per
	year.</para>

      <para>Each significant line of a <emphasis>crontab</emphasis>

    <para><command>anacron</command> is the daemon that completes
    <command>cron</command> for computers that are not on at all times.
    Since regular tasks are usually scheduled for the middle of the night,
    they will never be executed if the computer is off at that time. The
    purpose of <command>anacron</command> is to execute them, taking into
    account periods in which the computer is not working.</para>
    <indexterm><primary><command>anacron</command></primary></indexterm>

    <para>Please note that <command>anacron</command> will frequently
    execute such activity a few minutes after booting the machine, which
    can render the computer less responsive. This is why the tasks in the
    <filename>/etc/anacrontab</filename> file are started with the
    <command>nice</command> command, which reduces their execution priority
    and thus limits their impact on the rest of the system. Beware, the
    format of this file is not the same as that of
    <filename>/etc/crontab</filename>; if you have particular needs for
    <command>anacron</command>, see the

      <title><emphasis>BACK TO BASICS</emphasis> Priorities and <command>nice</command></title>

      <para>Unix systems (and thus Linux) are multi-tasking and multi-user
      systems. Indeed, several processes can run in parallel, and be owned
      by different users: the kernel mediates access to the resources
      between the different processes. As a part of this task, it has a
      concept of priority, which allows it to favor certain processes over
      others, as needed. When you know that a process can run in low
      priority, you can indicate so by running it with <command>nice
      <replaceable>program</replaceable></command>. The program will then
      have a smaller share of the CPU, and will have a smaller impact on
      other running processes. Of course, if no other processes needs to
      run, the program will not be artificially held back.</para>

      <para><command>nice</command> works with levels of “niceness”:
      the positive levels (from 1 to 19) progressively lower the priority,
      while the negative levels (from -1 to -20) will increase it — but
      only root can use these negative levels. Unless otherwise indicated
      (see the <citerefentry><refentrytitle>nice</refentrytitle>
      <manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry> manual page),
      <command>nice</command> increases the current level by 10.</para>

      <para>If you discover that an already running task should have been
      started with <command>nice</command> it is not too late to fix it;
      the <command>renice</command> command changes the priority of an
      already running process, in either direction (but reducing the
      “niceness” of a process is reserved to the root user).</para>

      <indexterm><primary><command>setquota</command></primary></indexterm>

      <para>The <command>setquota</command> program can be used in a script
      to automatically change many quotas. Its
      <citerefentry><refentrytitle>setquota</refentrytitle>
      <manvolnum>8</manvolnum></citerefentry> manual page details the
      syntax to use.</para>
    </sidebar>

    <para>The quota system allows you to set four limits:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>two limits (called “soft” and “hard”) refer to the
	number of blocks consumed. If the filesystem was created with a
	block-size of 1 kibibyte, a block contains 1024 bytes from the
	same file. Unsaturated blocks thus induce losses of disk space. A
	quota of 100 blocks, which theoretically allows storage of 102,400
	bytes, will however be saturated with just 100 files of 500 bytes
	each, only representing 50,000 bytes in total.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>two limits (soft and hard) refer to the number of inodes
	used. Each file occupies at least one inode to store information
	about it (permissions, owner, timestamp of last access, etc.). It
	is thus a limit on the number of user files.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>A “soft” limit can be temporarily exceeded; the user will
    simply be warned that they are exceeding the quota by the
    <command>warnquota</command> command, which is usually invoked by
    <command>cron</command>. A “hard” limit can never be exceeded: the
    system will refuse any operation that will cause a hard quota to be
    exceeded.</para>

      <indexterm><primary>block (disk)</primary></indexterm>
      <indexterm><primary>inode</primary></indexterm>

      <para>The filesystem divides the hard drive into blocks — small
      contiguous areas. The size of these blocks is defined during creation
      of the filesystem, and generally varies between 1 and 8
      kibibytes.</para>

      <para>A block can be used either to store the real data of a file, or
      for meta-data used by the filesystem. Among this meta-data, you will
      especially find the inodes. An inode uses a block on the hard drive
      (but this block is not taken into consideration in the block quota,
      only in the inode quota), and contains both the information on the
      file to which it corresponds (name, owner, permissions, etc.) and the
      pointers to the data blocks that are actually used. For very large
      files that occupy more blocks than it is possible to reference in a
      single inode, there is an indirect block system; the inode references
      a list of blocks that do not directly contain data, but another list
      of blocks.</para>

    <para>With the <command>edquota -t</command> command, you can define a
    maximum authorized “grace period” within which a soft limit may be
    exceeded. After this period, the soft limit will be treated like a
    hard limit, and the user will have to reduce their disk space usage to
    within this limit in order to be able to write anything to the hard
    drive.</para>

      <title><emphasis>GOING FURTHER</emphasis> Setting up a default quota for new users</title>

      <para>To automatically setup a quota for new users, you have to

      <command>setquota</command>) and indicate their user name in the
      <varname>QUOTAUSER</varname> variable in the

    <para>At Falcot Corp, backups have two goals: recovering erroneously
    deleted files, and quickly restoring any computer (server or desktop)
    whose hard drive has failed.</para>
    <section>
      <title>Backing Up with <command>rsync</command></title>

      <para>Backups on tape having been deemed too slow and costly, data
      will be backed up on hard drives on a dedicated server, on which the
      use of software RAID (see <xref linkend="sect.raid-soft"/>) will
      protect the data from hard drive failure. Desktop computers are not
      backed up individually, but users are advised that their personal
      account on their department's file server will be backed up. The
      <command>rsync</command> command (from the package of the same name)
      is used daily to back up these different servers.</para>

        <title><emphasis>BACK TO BASICS</emphasis> The hard link, a second name for the file</title>
        <indexterm><primary>link</primary><secondary>hard link</secondary></indexterm>
        <indexterm><primary>hard link</primary></indexterm>

	<para>A hard link, as opposed to a symbolic link, can not be
	differentiated from the linked file. Creating a hard link is
	essentially the same as giving an existing file a second name. This
	is why the deletion of a hard link only removes one of the names
	associated with the file. As long as another name is still assigned
	to the file, the data therein remain present on the filesystem. It
	is interesting to note that, unlike a copy, the hard link does not
	take up additional space on the hard drive.</para>

	<para>A hard link is created with the <command>ln
	<replaceable>target</replaceable>
	<replaceable>link</replaceable></command> command. The
	<replaceable>link</replaceable> file is then a new name for the
	<replaceable>target</replaceable> file. Hard links can only be
	created on the same filesystem, while symbolic links are not
	subject to this limitation.</para>
      </sidebar>

      <para>The available hard drive space prohibits implementation of a
      complete daily backup. As such, the <command>rsync</command> command
      is preceded by a duplication of the content of the previous backup
      with hard links, which prevents usage of too much hard drive space.
      The <command>rsync</command> process then only replaces files that
      have been modified since the last backup. With this mechanism a great
      number of backups can be kept in a small amount of space. Since all
      backups are immediately available and accessible (for example, in
      different directories of a given share on the network), you can
      quickly make comparisons between two given dates.</para>

      <para>This backup mechanism is easily implemented with the
      <command>dirvish</command> program. It uses a backup storage space
      (“bank” in its vocabulary) in which it places timestamped copies
      of sets of backup files (these sets are called “vaults” in the
      dirvish documentation).</para>

      <para>The main configuration is in the
      <filename>/etc/dirvish/master.conf</filename> file. It defines the
      location of the backup storage space, the list of “vaults” to
      manage, and default values for expiration of the backups. The rest of
      the configuration is located in the
      <filename><replaceable>bank</replaceable>/<replaceable>vault</replaceable>/dirvish/default.conf</filename>
      files and contains the specific configuration for the corresponding
      set of files.</para>

      </example>

      <para>The <literal>bank</literal> setting indicates the directory in
      which the backups are stored. The <literal>exclude</literal> setting
      allows you to indicate files (or file types) to exclude from the
      backup. The <literal>Runall</literal> is a list of file sets to
      backup with a time-stamp for each set, which allows you to assign the
      correct date to the copy, in case the backup is not triggered at
      precisely the assigned time. You have to indicate a time just before
      the actual execution time (which is, by default, 10:04 pm in Debian,
      according to <filename>/etc/cron.d/dirvish</filename>). Finally, the
      <literal>expire-default</literal> and <literal>expire-rule</literal>
      settings define the expiration policy for backups. The above example
      keeps forever backups that are generated on the first Sunday of each
      quarter, deletes after one year those from the first Sunday of each
      month, and after 3 months those from other Sundays. Other daily
      backups are kept for 15 days. The order of the rules does matter,
      Dirvish uses the last matching rule, or the
      <literal>expire-default</literal> one if no other
      <literal>expire-rule</literal> matches.</para>

      <para>The <emphasis>hotplug</emphasis> kernel subsystem loads drivers

      devices. The kernel has a database that associates each device ID
      with the required driver. This database is used during boot to load
      all the drivers for the peripheral devices detected on the different
      buses mentioned, but also when an additional hotplug device is

      <title>The Naming Problem</title>

      <para>Before the appearance of hotplug connections, it was easy to
      assign a fixed name to a device. It was based simply on the position
      of the devices on their respective bus. But this is not possible when
      such devices can come and go on the bus. The typical case is the use
      of a digital camera and a USB key, both of which appear to the
      computer as disk drives. The first one connected may be
      <filename>/dev/sdb</filename> and the second
      <filename>/dev/sdc</filename> (with <filename>/dev/sda</filename>
      representing the computer's own hard drive). The device name is not
      fixed; it depends on the order in which devices are connected.</para>

      <para>Additionally, more and more drivers use dynamic values for
      devices' major/minor numbers, which makes it impossible to have
      static entries for the given devices, since these essential
      characteristics may vary after a reboot.</para>

      <para><emphasis>udev</emphasis> was created precisely to solve this
      problem.</para>

      <sidebar>
        <title><emphasis>IN PRACTICE</emphasis> Network card management</title>

	<para>Many computers have multiple network cards (sometimes two
	wired interfaces and a wifi interface), and with
	<emphasis>hotplug</emphasis> support on most bus types, the 2.6
	kernel no longer guarantees fixed naming of network interfaces. But
	a user who wants to configure their network in
	<filename>/etc/network/interfaces</filename> needs a fixed
	name!</para>

	<para>It would be difficult to ask every user to create their own
	<emphasis>udev</emphasis> rules to address this problem. This is
	why <emphasis>udev</emphasis> was configured in a rather peculiar
	manner; on first boot (and, more generally, each time that a new
	network card appears) it uses the name of the network interface and
	its MAC address to create new rules that will reassign the same
	name on subsequent boots. These rules are stored in
	<filename>/etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules</filename>.</para>

	<para>This mechanism has some side effects that you should know
	about. Let's consider the case of computer that has only one PCI
	network card. The network interface is named
	<literal>eth0</literal>, logically. Now say the card breaks down,
	and the administrator replaces it; the new card will have a new MAC
	address. Since the old card was assigned the name,
	<literal>eth0</literal>, the new one will be assigned
	<literal>eth1</literal>, even though the <literal>eth0</literal>
	card is gone for good (and the network will not be functional
	because <filename>/etc/network/interfaces</filename> likely
	configures an <literal>eth0</literal> interface). In this case, it
	is enough to simply delete the
	<filename>/etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules</filename> file
	before rebooting the computer. The new card will then be given the
	expected <literal>eth0</literal> name.</para>
      </sidebar>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>How <emphasis>udev</emphasis> Works</title>

      <para>When <emphasis>udev</emphasis> is notified by the kernel of the
      appearance of a new device, it collects various information on the
      given device by consulting the corresponding entries in
      <filename>/sys/</filename>, especially those that uniquely identify
      it (MAC address for a network card, serial number for some USB
      devices, etc.).</para>

      <para>Armed with all of this information, <emphasis>udev</emphasis>
      then consults all of the rules contained in
      <filename>/etc/udev/rules.d/</filename> and
      <filename>/lib/udev/rules.d/</filename>. In this process it decides
      how to name the device, what symbolic links to create (to give it
      alternative names), and what commands to execute. All of these files
      are consulted, and the rules are all evaluated sequentially (except
      when a file uses “GOTO” directives). Thus, there may be several
      rules that correspond to a given event.</para>

      <para>The syntax of rules files is quite simple: each row contains
      selection criteria and variable assignments. The former are used to
      select events for which there is a need to react, and the latter
      defines the action to take. They are all simply separated with
      commas, and the operator implicitly differentiates between a
      selection criterion (with comparison operators, such as
      <literal>==</literal> or <literal>!=</literal>) or an assignment
      directive (with operators such as <literal>=</literal>,
      <literal>+=</literal> or <literal>:=</literal>).</para>

      <para>Comparison operators are used on the following
      variables:</para>

      </itemizedlist>

      <para>The right operands can use pattern expressions to match several
      values at the same time. For instance, <literal>*</literal> matches
      any string (even an empty one); <literal>?</literal> matches any
      character, and <literal>[]</literal> matches the set of characters
      listed between the square brackets (or the opposite thereof if the
      first character is an exclamation point, and contiguous ranges of
      characters are indicated like <literal>a-z</literal>).</para>

      <para>Regarding the assignment operators, <literal>=</literal>
      assigns a value (and replaces the current value); in the case of a
      list, it is emptied and contains only the value assigned.
      <literal>:=</literal> does the same, but prevents later changes to
      the same variable. As for <literal>+=</literal>, it adds an item to a
      list. The following variables can be changed:</para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
	  <para><literal>NAME</literal>: the device filename to be created
	  in <filename>/dev/</filename>. Only the first assignment counts;
	  the others are ignored;</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
	  <para><literal>SYMLINK</literal>: the list of symbolic links that
	  will point to the same device;</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
	  <para><literal>OWNER</literal>, <literal>GROUP</literal> and
	  <literal>MODE</literal> define the user and group that owns the
	  device, as well as the associated permission;</para>

	  <para><literal>RUN</literal>: the list of programs to execute in
	  response to this event.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>The values assigned to these variables may use a number of
      substitutions:</para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
	  <para><literal>$kernel</literal> or <literal>%k</literal>:

      <para>To create a new rule, you can use tests on the device's
      variables, as well as those of one of the parent devices. The above
      case allows us to create two rules like these:</para>

      <programlisting>KERNEL=="sd?", SUBSYSTEM=="block", ATTRS{serial}=="M004021000001", SYMLINK+="usb_key/disk"
KERNEL=="sd?[0-9]", SUBSYSTEM=="block", ATTRS{serial}=="M004021000001", SYMLINK+="usb_key/part%n"
</programlisting>

      <para>Once these rules are set in a file, named for example
      <filename>/etc/udev/rules.d/010_local.rules</filename>, you can
      simply remove and reconnect the USB key. You can then see that
      <filename>/dev/usb_key/disk</filename> represents the disk associated
      with the USB key, and <filename>/dev/usb_key/part1</filename> is its
      first partition.</para>

    <para>The topic of power management is often problematic. Indeed,
    properly suspending the computer requires that all the computer's
    device drivers know how to put them to standby, and that they properly
    reconfigure the devices upon waking. Unfortunately, there are still
    many devices unable to sleep well under Linux, because their
    manufacturers have not provided the required specifications.</para>

      <para>The software suspend banner rallies several recent efforts to
      integrate reliable hibernation under Linux, on disk or in memory.
      Recent kernels are relatively reliable in that regard, when used in
      cooperation with tools of the <emphasis role="pkg">uswsusp</emphasis>
      package. Unfortunately the problems related to hibernation are not
      yet ancient history, and you should run tests on your hardware before
      putting too much faith in its ability to wake from suspend.</para>

      ACPI, Matthew Garrett has an excellent article about this in his

      <para>APM (Advanced Power Management) control is present in all
      Debian kernels, but disabled by default. To activate it, you add the
      <literal>apm=on</literal> option to the kernel parameters passed at
      boot time. With LILO, you would add the
      <literal>append="apm=on"</literal> directive to the block indicating
      which image to boot (in the <filename>/etc/lilo.conf</filename>
      file), and relaunch <command>lilo</command>. With GRUB2, you simply

    <para>Every time you connect or remove a card, the daemon configures or

    <filename>/etc/pcmcia/</filename> directory, which gets its settings
    from the <filename>/etc/pcmcia/*.opts</filename> files. These files
    have been slightly adapted to work with a Debian system; the
    configuration of the network is delegated to <command>ifup</command> if
    the <filename>/etc/pcmcia/network.opts</filename> file does not take
    care of it. The same is true for configuration of a wireless network,
    which can be specified in <filename>/etc/network/interfaces</filename>
    instead of <filename>/etc/pcmcia/wireless.opts</filename>. The
