  <title>Solving Problems and Finding Relevant Information</title>
  <highlights>
    <para>For an administrator, the most important skill is to be able to
    cope with any situation, known or unknown. This chapter gives a number
    of methods that will — hopefully — allow you to isolate the cause
    of any problem that you will encounter, so that you may be able to
    resolve them.</para>

    <para>Before you can understand what is really going on when there is a
    problem, you need to know the theoretical role played by each program
    involved in the problem. To do this, the best reflex to have is consult
    their documentation; but since these documentations are many and
    can be scattered far and wide, you should know all the places where they can be
    found.</para>

        <title><emphasis>CULTURE</emphasis> <acronym>RTFM</acronym></title>
        <indexterm><primary><acronym>RTFM</acronym></primary></indexterm>

	<para>This acronym stands for “Read the F***ing Manual”, but
	can also be expanded in a friendlier variant, “Read the Fine
	Manual”. This phrase is sometimes used in (terse) responses to
	questions from newbies. It is rather abrupt, and betrays a certain
	annoyance at a question asked by someone who has not even bothered
	to read the documentation. Some say that this classic response is
	better than no response at all (since it indicates that the
	documentation contains the information sought), or than a more
	verbose and angry answer.</para>

	<para>In any case, if someone responds “RTFM” to you, it is
	often wise not to take offense. Since this answer may be
	perceived as vexing, you might want to try and avoid receiving
	it. If the information that you need is not in the manual,
	which can happen, you might want to say so, preferably in your
	initial question. You should also describe the various steps
	that you have personally taken to find information before you
	raised a question on a forum.  Eric Raymond listed a few
	guidelines, widely accepted as common sense, for what to do
	before asking for help on forums. <ulink

	url="http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html"/></para>
      </sidebar>

      <para>Manual pages, while relatively terse in style, contain a
      great deal of essential information. We will quickly go over the
      command for viewing them. Simply type <command>man
      <replaceable>manual-page</replaceable></command> — the manual
      page usually goes by the same name as the command whose
      documentation is sought. For example, to learn about the
      possible options for the <command>cp</command> command, you
      would type the <command>man cp</command> command at the shell
      prompt (see sidebar).</para>

      
      <sidebar>
        <title><emphasis>BACK TO BASICS</emphasis> The shell, a command line interpreter</title>
        <indexterm><primary>command line interpreter</primary></indexterm>
        <indexterm><primary>shell</primary></indexterm>

	<para>A command line interpreter, also called a “shell”, is a
	program that executes commands that are either entered by the user
	or stored in a script. In interactive mode, it displays a prompt
	(usually ending in <literal>$</literal> for a normal user, or by
	<literal>#</literal> for an administrator) indicating that it is
	ready to read a new command. <xref
	linkend="short-remedial-course"/> describes the basics of using the
	shell.</para>

	<para>The default and most commonly used shell is
	<command>bash</command> (Bourne Again SHell), but there are others,
	including <command>dash</command>, <command>csh</command>,
	<command>tcsh</command> and <command>zsh</command>.</para>

	<para>Among other things, most shells offer help during input at
	the prompt, such as the completion of command or file names (which
	you can generally activate by pressing the tab key), or recalling
	previous commands (history management).</para>
      </sidebar>

      <para>Man pages not only document programs accessible from the
      command line, but also configuration files, system calls, C library
      functions, and so forth. Sometimes names can collide. For example,
      the shell's <command>read</command> command has the same name as the
      <function>read</function> system call. This is why manual pages are
      organized in numbered sections:</para>
      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
	  <para>commands that can be executed from the command line;</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
	  <para>system calls (functions provided by the kernel);</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
	  <para>library functions (provided by system libraries);</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
	  <para>devices (on Unix-like systems, these are special files, usually
	  placed in the <filename>/dev/</filename> directory);</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
	  <para>configuration files (formats and conventions);</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
	  <para>games;</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
	  <para>sets of macros and standards;</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
	  <para>system administration commands;</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
	  <para>kernel routines.</para>
        </listitem>
      </orderedlist>

      <para>It is possible to specify the section of the manual page that
      you are looking for: to view the documentation for the
      <function>read</function> system call, you would type <command>man 2
      read</command>. When no section is explicitly specified, the first
      section that has a manual page with the requested name will be shown.
      Thus, <command>man shadow</command> returns
      <citerefentry><refentrytitle>shadow</refentrytitle><manvolnum>5</manvolnum></citerefentry>
      because there are no manual pages for
      <foreignphrase>shadow</foreignphrase> in sections 1 to 4.</para>

      <sidebar>
        <title><emphasis>TIP</emphasis> <command>whatis</command></title>
        <indexterm><primary><command>whatis</command></primary></indexterm>

	<para>If you do not want to look at the full manual page, but only
	a short description to confirm that it is what you are looking for,
	simply enter <command>whatis
	<replaceable>command</replaceable></command>.</para>

        <screen>
<computeroutput>$ </computeroutput><userinput>whatis scp</userinput>
<computeroutput>scp (1)     - secure copy (remote file copy program)</computeroutput>
</screen>

	<para>This short description is included in the
	<emphasis>NAME</emphasis> section at the beginning of all manual
	pages.</para>
      </sidebar>

      <para>Of course, if you do not know the names of the commands,
      the manual is not going to be of much use to you. This is the
      purpose of the <command>apropos</command> command, which helps
      you conduct a search in the manual pages, or more specifically
      in their short descriptions. Each manual page begins essentially
      with a one line summary. <command>apropos</command> returns a
      list of manual pages whose summary mentions the requested
      keyword(s). If you choose them well, you will find the name of
      the command that you need.</para>

      <example>
        <title>Finding <command>cp</command> with <command>apropos</command></title>

        <screen>
<computeroutput>$ </computeroutput><userinput>apropos "copy file"</userinput>
<computeroutput>cp (1)               - copy files and directories
cpio (1)             - copy files to and from archives
hcopy (1)            - copy files from or to an HFS volume
install (1)          - copy files and set attributes
</computeroutput>
</screen>
      </example>

      <sidebar>
        <title><emphasis>TIP</emphasis> Browsing by following links</title>

	<para>Many manual pages have a “SEE ALSO” section, usually at
	the end. It refers to other manual pages relevant to similar
	commands, or to external documentation. In this way, it is possible
	to find relevant documentation even when the first choice is not
	optimal.</para>
      </sidebar>

      <para>The <command>man</command> command is not the only means of
      consulting the manual pages, since <command>konqueror</command> (in
      KDE) and <command>yelp</command> (under GNOME) programs also offer
      this possibility. There is also a web interface, provided by the
      <command>man2html</command> package, which allows you to view manual
      pages in a web browser. On a computer where this package is
      installed, use this URL: <ulink type="block"
      url="http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html"/></para>

      <para>This utility requires a web server. This is why you should
      choose to install this package on one of your servers: all users of
      the local network could benefit from this service (including
      non-Linux machines), and this will allow you not to set up an HTTP
      server on each workstation. If your server is also accessible from
      other networks, it may be desirable to restrict access to this
      service only to users of the local network.</para>
      <indexterm><primary><command>man2html</command></primary></indexterm>

      <sidebar>
        <title><emphasis>DEBIAN POLICY</emphasis> Required man pages</title>

	<para>Debian requires each program to have a manual page. If the
	upstream author does not provide one, the Debian package maintainer
	will usually write a minimal page that will at the very least
	direct the reader to the location of the original
	documentation.</para>
      </sidebar>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title><emphasis>info</emphasis> Documents</title>
      <indexterm><primary><emphasis>info</emphasis></primary></indexterm>
      <indexterm><primary>GNU</primary><secondary>Info</secondary></indexterm>

      <para>The GNU project has written manuals for most of its programs in
      the <emphasis>info</emphasis> format; this is why many manual pages
      refer to the corresponding <emphasis>info</emphasis> documentation.
      This format offers some advantages, but the program to view these
      documents is also slightly more complex.</para>

      <para>It is of course called <command>info</command>, and it takes
      the name of the “node” to be consulted as argument. The
      <emphasis>info</emphasis> documentation has a hierarchical structure,
      and if you invoke <command>info</command> without parameters, it will
      display a list of the nodes available at the first level. Usually,
      nodes bear the name of the corresponding commands.</para>

      <para>The navigation controls in the documentation are not
      particularly intuitive. The best method to familiarize yourself with
      the program is probably to invoke it, then enter
      <userinput>h</userinput> (for “help”), and then follow the
      instructions to learn through practice. Alternatively, you could also
      use a graphical browser, which is a lot more user-friendly. Again,
      <command>konqueror</command> and <command>yelp</command> work; the
      <command>info2www</command> also provides a web interface. <ulink
      type="block" url="http://localhost/cgi-bin/info2www"/></para>
      <indexterm><primary><command>info2www</command></primary></indexterm>

      <para>Note that the <emphasis>info</emphasis> system does not allow
      translation, unlike the <command>man</command> page system.
      <emphasis>info</emphasis> documents are thus always in English.
      However, when you ask the <command>info</command> program to display
      a non-existing <emphasis>info</emphasis> page, it will fall back on
      the <emphasis>man</emphasis> page by the same name (if it exists),
      which might be translated.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Specific Documentation</title>
      <indexterm><primary>documentation</primary></indexterm>

      <para>Each package includes its own documentation. Even the least
      well documented programs generally have a <filename>README</filename>
      file containing some interesting and/or important information. This
      documentation is installed in the
      <filename>/usr/share/doc/<replaceable>package</replaceable>/</filename>
      directory (where <replaceable>package</replaceable> represents the
      name of the package). If the documentation is particularly large, it
      may not be included in the program's main package, but might be
      offloaded to a dedicated package which is usually named
      <literal><replaceable>package</replaceable>-doc</literal>. The main
      package generally recommends the documentation package so that you
      can easily find it.</para>
      <indexterm><primary><filename>README.Debian</filename></primary></indexterm>
      <indexterm><primary><filename>changelog.Debian.gz</filename></primary></indexterm>
      <indexterm><primary><filename>NEWS.Debian.gz</filename></primary></indexterm>

      <para>The
      <filename>/usr/share/doc/<replaceable>package</replaceable>/</filename>
      directory also contains some files provided by Debian which
      complete the documentation by specifying the package's
      particularities or improvements compared to a traditional
      installation of the software. The <filename>README.Debian</filename>
      file also indicates all of the adaptations that were made to comply
      with the Debian Policy. The <filename>changelog.Debian.gz</filename>
      file allows the user to follow the modifications made to the package
      over time: it is very useful to try to understand what has changed
      between two installed versions that do not have the same behavior.
      Finally, there is sometimes a <filename>NEWS.Debian.gz</filename>
      file which documents the major changes in the program that may
      directly concern the administrator.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Websites</title>

      <para>In most cases, free software programs have websites that are
      used to distribute it and to bring together the community of its developers
      and users. These sites are frequently loaded with relevant
      information in various forms: official documentation, FAQ (Frequently
      Asked Questions), mailing list archives, etc. Often, problems that
      you may have have already been the subject of many questions; the FAQ
      or mailing list archives may have a solution for it. A good mastery
      of search engines will prove immensely valuable to find relevant
      pages quickly (by restricting the search to the Internet domain or
      sub-domain dedicated to the program). If the search returns too many
      pages or if the results do not match what you seek, you can add the
      keyword <userinput>debian</userinput> to limit results and target
      relevant information.</para>

      <sidebar>
        <title><emphasis>TIPS</emphasis> From error to solution</title>

	<para>If the software returns a very specific error message, enter
	it into the search engine (between double quotes,
	<literal>"</literal>, in order to search not for individual
	keywords, but for the complete phrase). In most cases, the first
	links returned will contain the answer that you need.</para>

	<para>In other cases, you will get very general errors, such as
	“Permission denied”. In this case, it is best to check the
	permissions of the elements involved (files, user ID, groups,
	etc.).</para>
      </sidebar>

      <para>If you do not know the address for the software's website,
      there are various means of getting it. First, check if there is a
      <literal>Homepage</literal> field in the package's meta-information
      (<command>apt-cache show
      <replaceable>package</replaceable></command>). Alternately, the
      package description may contain a link to the program's official
      website. If no URL is indicated, look at
      <filename>/usr/share/doc/<replaceable>package</replaceable>/copyright</filename>.
      The Debian maintainer generally indicates in this file where they got
      the program's source code, and this is likely to be the website that
      you need to find. If at this stage your search is still unfruitful,
      consult a free software directory, such as Freecode.com (formerly Freshmeat.net) or
      Framasoft, or search directly with a search engine, such as Google or
      Yahoo. <ulink type="block" url="http://freecode.com/"/> <ulink
      type="block" url="http://framasoft.org/"/></para>

      <indexterm><primary><foreignphrase>Freecode</foreignphrase></primary></indexterm>
      <indexterm><primary><emphasis>wiki.debian.org</emphasis></primary></indexterm>

      <para>You might also want to check the Debian wiki, a
      collaborative website where anybody, even simple visitors, can
      make suggestions directly from their browsers. It is used
      equally by developers who design and specify their projects and
      by users who share their knowledge by writing documents
      collaboratively. <ulink type="block"

      <title>Tutorials (<emphasis>HOWTO</emphasis>)</title>
      <indexterm><primary><emphasis>HOWTO</emphasis></primary></indexterm>

      <para>A howto is a document that describes, in concrete terms
      and step by step, “how to” reach a predefined goal. The covered
      goals are relatively varied, but often technical in nature: for
      example, setting up IP Masquerading, configuring software RAID,
      installing a Samba server, etc. These documents often attempt to
      cover all of the potential problems likely to occur during the
      implementation of a given technology.</para>

      <para>Many such tutorials are managed by the Linux Documentation
      Project (LDP), whose website hosts all of these documents:<ulink
      type="block" url="http://www.tldp.org/"/> </para>
      <indexterm><primary>LDP</primary></indexterm>
      <indexterm><primary>Linux Documentation Project</primary></indexterm>

      <para>These documents should be taken with a grain of salt. They
      are often several years old; the information they contain is
      sometimes obsolete. This phenomenon is even more frequent for
      their translations, since updates are neither systematic nor
      instant after the publication of a new version of the original
      documents. This is part of the joys of working in a volunteer
      environment and without constraints…</para>

    <para>The purpose of this section is to present some general tips on
    certain operations that an administrator will frequently have to
    perform. These procedures will of course not cover every possible case
    in an exhaustive way, but they may serve as starting points for the
    more difficult cases.</para>

      <title><emphasis>DISCOVERY</emphasis> Documentation in French</title>

      <para>Often, documentation translated into a non-English language is
      available in a separate package with the name of the corresponding
      package, followed by
      <literal>-<replaceable>lang</replaceable></literal> (where
      <replaceable>lang</replaceable> is the two-letter ISO code for the
      language).</para>

      <para>For instance, the <emphasis>apt-howto-fr</emphasis>
      package contains the French translation of the howto for
      <emphasis>APT</emphasis>.  Likewise, the
      <emphasis>quick-reference-fr</emphasis> and
      <emphasis>debian-reference-fr</emphasis> packages are the French
      versions of the reference guides for Debian (initially written

      <title>Configuring a Program</title>
      <indexterm><primary>configuration</primary><secondary>program configuration</secondary></indexterm>
      <indexterm><primary>program</primary><secondary>configuration</secondary></indexterm>

      <para>When you want to configure an unknown package, you must proceed
      in stages. First, you should read what the package maintainer has
      documented. Reading
      <filename>/usr/share/doc/<replaceable>package</replaceable>/README.Debian</filename>
      will indeed allow you to learn of specific provisions made to
      simplify the use of the software. It is sometimes essential in order
      to understand the differences from the original behavior of the
      program, as described in the general documentation, such as howtos.
      Sometimes this file also details the most common errors in order for
      you to avoid wasting time on common problems.</para>

      <para>Then, you should look at the software's official documentation
      — refer to the previous section to identify the various existing
      documentation sources. The <command>dpkg -L
      <replaceable>package</replaceable></command> command gives a list of files
      included in the package; you can therefore quickly identify the
      available documentation (as well as the configuration files, located
      in <filename>/etc/</filename>). <command>dpkg -s
      <replaceable>package</replaceable></command> displays the package
      meta-data and shows any possible recommended or suggested packages; in
      there, you can find documentation or a utility that will ease the
      configuration of the software.</para>

      <para>Finally, the configuration files are often self-documented by
      many explanatory comments detailing the various possible values for
      each configuration setting. So much so that it is sometimes enough to
      just choose a line to activate from among those available. In some
      cases, examples of configuration files are provided in the
      <filename>/usr/share/doc/<replaceable>package</replaceable>/examples/</filename>
      directory. They may serve as a basis for your own configuration
      file.</para>

      <sidebar>
        <title><emphasis>DEBIAN POLICY</emphasis> Location of examples</title>
        <indexterm><primary>examples, location</primary></indexterm>

	<para>All examples must be installed in the
	<filename>/usr/share/doc/<replaceable>package</replaceable>/examples/</filename>
	directory. This may be a configuration file, program source code
	(an example of the use of a library), or a data conversion script
	that the administrator can use in certain cases (such as to
	initialize a database). If the example is specific to a particular
	architecture, it should be installed in
	<filename>/usr/lib/<replaceable>package</replaceable>/examples/</filename>
	and there should be a link pointing to that file in the
	<filename>/usr/share/doc/<replaceable>package</replaceable>/examples/</filename>
	directory.</para>

      <title>Monitoring What Daemons Are Doing</title>

      <para>Understanding what a daemon does is somewhat more
      complicated, since it does not interact directly with the
      administrator. To check that a daemon is actually working, you need
      to test it. For example, to check the Apache (web server) daemon,
      test it with an HTTP request.</para>

      <para>To allow such tests, each daemon generally records everything
      that it does, as well as any errors that it encounters, in what are
      called “log files” or “system logs”. Logs are stored in
      <filename>/var/log/</filename> or one of its subdirectories. To know
      the precise name of a log file for each daemon, see its
      documentation. Note: a single test is not always sufficient if it
      does not cover all the possible usage cases; some problems only occur
      in particular circumstances.</para>

      <sidebar>
        <title><emphasis>TOOL</emphasis> The <command>rsyslogd</command> daemon</title>
        <indexterm><primary><command>syslogd</command></primary></indexterm>
        <indexterm><primary>logs</primary><secondary>files</secondary></indexterm>
        <indexterm><primary>files</primary><secondary>logs</secondary></indexterm>

	<para><command>rsyslogd</command> is special: it collects logs
	(internal system messages) that are sent to it by other
	programs.  Each log entry is associated with a subsystem
	(e-mail, kernel, authentication, etc.) and a priority;
	<command>rsyslogd</command> processes these two pieces of
	information to decide on what to do. The log message may be
	recorded in various log files, and/or sent to an

	<para>A daemon is a program that is not explicitly invoked by the
	user and that stays in the background, waiting for a certain
	condition to be met before performing a task. Many server programs
	are daemons, a term that explains that the letter “d” is
	frequently present at the end of their name
	(<command>sshd</command>, <command>smtpd</command>,
	<command>httpd</command>, etc.).</para>
      </sidebar>

      <para>As a preventive operation, the administrator should
      regularly read the most relevant server logs. They can thus
      diagnose problems before they are even reported by disgruntled
      users.  Indeed users may sometimes wait for a problem to occur
      repeatedly over several days before reporting it.  In many
      cases, there are specific tools to analyze the contents of the
      larger log files.  In particular, such utilities exist for web
      servers (such as <command>analog</command>,
      <command>awstats</command>, <command>webalizer</command> for
      Apache), for FTP servers, for proxy/cache servers, for
      firewalls, for e-mail servers, for DNS servers, and even for
      print servers.  Some of these utilities operate in a modular
      manner and allow analysis of several types of log files.  This
      is the case of <command>lire</command> or also
      <command>modlogan</command>.  Other tools, such as
      <command>logcheck</command> (a software discussed in <xref
      linkend="security"/>), scan these files in search of alerts to
      be dealt with.</para>

      <title>Asking for Help on a Mailing List</title>

      <para>If your various searches haven't helped you to get to the root
      of a problem, it is possible to get help from other, perhaps more
      experienced people. This is indeed the purpose of the
      <email>debian-user@lists.debian.org</email> mailing list. As with any
      community, it has rules that need to be followed. Before asking any
      question, you should check that your problem isn't already covered by
      recent discussions on the list or by any official documentation.

	<para>For high volume mailing lists, such as
	<email>debian-user@lists.debian.org</email>, it may be worthwhile
	to go through them as a discussion forum (or newsgroup). Gmane.org
	allows consultation of the Debian lists in this format. The list
	mentioned above is available at: <ulink type="block"
	url="http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.linux.debian.user"/></para>

        <title><emphasis>BACK TO BASICS</emphasis> Netiquette applies</title>

	<para>In general, for all correspondence on e-mail lists, the rules
	of Netiquette should be followed. This term refers to a set of
	common sense rules, from common courtesy to mistakes that should be
	avoided. <ulink type="block"
	url="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1855"/>
	<indexterm><primary>Netiquette</primary></indexterm></para>
      </sidebar>

      <para>Once those two conditions are met, you can think of
      describing your problem to the mailing list. Include as much relevant
      information as possible: various tests conducted, documentation
      consulted, how you attempted to diagnose the problem, the packages
      concerned or those that may be involved, etc. Check the Debian Bug
      Tracking System (BTS, described in sidebar <xref
      linkend="sidebar.bts"/>) for similar problems, and mention the results
      of that search, providing links to bugs found. BTS starts on: <ulink
      type="block" url="http://www.debian.org/Bugs/index.html"/></para>

      <para>The more courteous and precise you have been, the greater
      your chances are of getting an answer, or, at least, some
      elements of response. If you receive relevant information by
      private e-mail, think of summarizing this information publicly
      so that others can benefit. This also allows the list's
      archives, searched through various search engines, to show the
      resolution for others who may have the same question.</para>

      <title>Reporting a Bug When a Problem Is Too Difficult</title>
      <indexterm><primary>report a bug</primary></indexterm>
      <indexterm><primary>bug report</primary></indexterm>

      <para>If all of your efforts to resolve a problem fail, it is
      possible that a resolution is not your responsibility, and that the
      problem is due to a bug in the program. In this case, the proper
      procedure is to report the bug to Debian or directly to the upstream
      developers. To do this, isolate the problem as much as possible and
      create a minimal test situation in which it can be reproduced. If you
      know which program is the apparent cause of the problem, you can find
      its corresponding package using the command, <command>dpkg -S
      <replaceable>file_in_question</replaceable></command>. Check the Bug
      Tracking System
      (<literal>http://bugs.debian.org/<replaceable>package</replaceable></literal>)
      to ensure that the bug has not already been reported. You can then
      send your own bug report, using the <command>reportbug</command>
      command, including as much information as possible, especially a
      complete description of those minimal test cases that will allow
      anyone to recreate the bug.</para>
