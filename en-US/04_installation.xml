  <highlights>
    <para>To use Debian, you need to install it on a computer; this task is
    taken care of by the <emphasis>debian-installer</emphasis> program. A
    proper installation involves many operations. This chapter reviews them
    in their chronological order.</para>

  <para>The installer for <emphasis role="distribution">Wheezy</emphasis>
  is based on <command>debian-installer</command>. Its modular design
  enables it to work in various scenarios and allows it to evolve and adapt
  to changes. Despite the limitations implied by the need to support a
  large number of architectures, this installer is very accessible to
  beginners, since it assists users at each stage of the process. Automatic
  hardware detection, guided partitioning, and graphical user interfaces
  have solved most of the problems that newbies used to face in the
  early years of Debian.</para>

  <para>Installation requires 80 MB of RAM (Random Access Memory) and at
  least 700 MB of hard drive space. All Falcot computers meet these
  criteria. Note, however, that these figures apply to the installation of
  a very limited system without a graphical desktop. A minimum of 512 MB
  of RAM and 5 GB of hard drive space are really recommended for a basic
  office desktop workstation.</para>

    <title><emphasis>BEWARE</emphasis> Upgrading from Squeeze</title>

    <para>If you already have Debian Squeeze installed on your computer, this
    chapter is not for you! Unlike other distributions, Debian allows
    updating a system from one version to the next without having to
    reinstall the system. Reinstalling, in addition to being unnecessary,
    could even be dangerous, since it could remove already installed
    programs.</para>

    <title>Installation Methods</title>

    <para>A Debian system can be installed from several types of media, as
    long as the BIOS of the machine allows it. You can for instance boot
    with a CD-ROM, a USB key, or even through a network.</para>

      <indexterm><primary>Basic Input/Output System</primary></indexterm>

      <para>BIOS (which stands for Basic Input/Output System) is a software
      that is included in the motherboard (the electronic board connecting
      all peripherals) and executed when the computer is booted, in order
      to load an operating system (via an adapted bootloader). It stays in
      the background to provide an interface between the hardware and the
      software (in our case, the Linux kernel).</para>
    </sidebar>
    <section id="sect.install-cd">
      <title>Installing from a CD-ROM/DVD-ROM</title>

      <para>The most widely used installation method is from a CD-ROM
      (or DVD-ROM, which behaves exactly the same way): the computer
      is booted from this media, and the installation program takes
      over.</para>

      <para>Various CD-ROM families have different purposes:
      <emphasis>netinst</emphasis> (network installation) contains the
      installer and the base Debian system; all other programs are
      then downloaded. Its “image”, that is the ISO-9660 filesystem
      that contains the exact contents of the disk, only takes up
      about 150 to 250 MB (depending on architecture).
      On the other hand, the complete set offers all packages and
      allows for installation on a computer that has no Internet
      access; it requires around 70 CD-ROMs (or 10 DVD-ROMs, or two
      Blu-ray disks).  But the programs are divided among the disks
      according to their popularity and importance; the first three
      disks will be sufficient for most installations, since they
      contain the most used software.</para>

      <para>There used to also be a <emphasis>businesscard</emphasis>
      or <emphasis>bizcard</emphasis> CD-ROM, which only provided the
      installer, and which required all the Debian packages (including
      the base system) to be downloaded. Since its image only took up
      35 MB, it was meant to be burnt on a “business card” type
      CD-ROM.  This CD-ROM is no longer provided for Wheezy: providing
      it required extra work for the maintainers of the installer, for
      very little actual use compared to the
      <emphasis>netinst</emphasis> CD-ROMs.</para>

      <sidebar>
        <title><emphasis>TIP</emphasis> Multi-architecture disks</title>

	<para>Most installation CD- and DVD-ROMs work only with a specific
	hardware architecture. If you wish to download the complete images,
	you must take care to choose those which work on the hardware of
	the computer on which you wish to install them.</para>

	<para>Some CD/DVD-ROM images can work on several
	architectures. We thus have a CD-ROM image for the
	<emphasis>i386</emphasis> and <emphasis>amd64</emphasis>
	architectures. There is also a DVD-ROM image that contains the
	installer and a selection of binary packages for
	<emphasis>i386</emphasis> and <emphasis>amd64</emphasis>, as
	well as the corresponding source packages.</para>

      <title id="demarrage-cle-usb">Booting from a USB Key</title>
      <indexterm><primary>USB key</primary></indexterm>

      <para>Since recent computers are able to boot from USB devices, you
      can also install Debian from a USB key (this is nothing more than a
      small flash-memory disk). Be aware, however, that not all BIOSes are
      the same; some are able to boot from USB 2.0 devices, while others
      only work with USB 1.1. Besides, the USB key must have 512-bytes
      sectors, and this feature, while common, is never documented on the
      packaging of the keys you find for sale.</para>

      <para>The installation manual explains how to create a USB key
      that contains the <command>debian-installer</command>. The
      procedure has been significantly simplified for the <emphasis
      role="distribution">Squeeze</emphasis> release compared to the
      previous versions; the ISO images for i386 and amd64
      architectures are now hybrid images that can boot from a CD-ROM
      as well as from a USB key.</para>

      <para>You must first identify the device name of the USB key
      (ex: <literal>/dev/sdb</literal>); the simplest means to do this
      is to check the messages issued by the kernel using the
      <command>dmesg</command> command. Then you must copy the
      previously downloaded ISO image (for example
      debian-7.0.0-amd64-i386-netinst.iso) with the command
      <command>cat debian-7.0.0-amd64-i386-netinst.iso &gt;/dev/sdb;
      sync</command>.  This command requires administrator rights,
      since it accesses the USB key directly and blindly erases its
      content.</para>

      <para>A more detailed explanation is available in the installation
      manual. Among other things, it describes an alternative method of
      preparing a USB key that is more complex, but that allows to
      customize the installer's default options (those set in the kernel
      command line). <ulink type="block"

      <para>Many BIOSes allow booting directly from the network by
      downloading a kernel and a minimal filesystem image. This method
      (which has several names, such as <acronym>PXE</acronym> or
      <acronym>TFTP</acronym> boot) can be a life-saver if the
      computer does not have a CD-ROM reader, or if the BIOS can't
      boot from such media.</para>

      <para>This installation method works in two steps. First, while
      booting the computer, the BIOS (or the network card) issues a
      BOOTP/DHCP request to automatically acquire an IP address. When a
      BOOTP or DHCP server returns a response, it includes a filename, as
      well as network settings. After having configured the network, the
      client computer then issues a TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol)
      request for a file whose name was previously indicated. Once this
      file is acquired, it is executed as though it were a bootloader. This
      then launches the Debian installation program, which is executed as
      though it were running from the hard drive, a CD-ROM, or a USB
      key.</para>

      <para>All the details of this method are available in the
      installation guide (“Preparing files for TFTP Net Booting”
      section). <ulink type="block"

      <title>Other Installation Methods</title>

      <para>When we have to deploy customized installations for a large
      number of computers, we generally choose an automated rather than a
      manual installation method. Depending on the situation and the
      complexity of the installations to be made, we can use FAI (Fully
      Automatic Installer, described in <xref linkend="sect.fai"/>), or even a
      customized installation CD with preseeding (see <xref
      linkend="sect.d-i-preseeding"/>).</para>

      <title>Booting and Starting the Installer</title>

      <para>Once the BIOS has begun booting from the CD- or DVD-ROM, the
      Isolinux bootloader menu appears. At this stage, the Linux kernel is
      not yet loaded; this menu allows you to choose the kernel to boot and
      enter possible parameters to be transferred to it in the
      process.</para>

      <para>For a standard installation, you only need to choose
      “Install” or “Graphical install” (with the arrow keys), then
      press the <keycap>Enter</keycap> key to initiate the remainder
      of the installation process. If the DVD-ROM is a “Multi-arch”
      disk (such as the one included with this book), and the machine
      has an Intel or AMD 64 bit processor, the menu options “64 bit
      install” and “64 bit graphical install” enable the installation
      of the 64 bit variant (<emphasis>amd64</emphasis>) instead of
      the default 32 bit variant (<emphasis>i386</emphasis>). In
      practice, the 64 bit version can almost always be used: most
      recent processors are 64 bit processors and the 64 bit version deals
      better with the large amount of RAM that new computers tend to have.

	<para>The fundamental difference between 32 and 64 bit systems is
	the size of memory addresses. In theory, a 32 bit system can not
	work with more than 4 GB of RAM (2<superscript>32</superscript>
	bytes). In practice, it is possible to work around this limitation
	by using the <literal>686-pae</literal> kernel variant, so long
	as the processor handles the PAE (Physical Address Extension)
	functionality. Using it does have a notable influence on system
	performance, however. This is why it is useful to use the 64 bit
	mode on a server with a large amount of RAM.</para>

	<para>For an office computer (where a few percent difference in
	performance is negligible), you must keep in mind that some
	proprietary programs are not available in 64 bit versions (such as
	Skype, for
	example). It is technically possible to make them work on 64 bit
	systems, but you have to install the 32 bit versions of all the
	necessary libraries (see <xref linkend="sect.multi-arch" />), and
	often to use <command>setarch</command> or

	<para>If the computer is already running Windows, it is not
	necessary to delete the system in order to install Debian. You can
	have both systems at once, each installed on a separate disk or
	partition, and choose which to start when booting the computer.
	This configuration is often called “dual boot”, and the Debian
	installation system can set it up. This is done during the hard
	drive partitioning stage of installation and while setting up the
	bootloader (see the sidebars in those sections).</para>

	<para>If you already have a working Windows system, you can even
	avoid using a CD-ROM; Debian offers a Windows program that
	will download a light Debian installer and set it up on the hard
	disk. You then only need to reboot the computer and choose between
	normal Windows boot or booting the installation program. You can
	also find it on a dedicated website with a rather explicit name…

	<para>The bootloader is a low-level program that is

	passes off its control. To handle this task, it must be able
	to locate the Linux kernel to boot on the disk. On the i386
	and amd64 architectures, the two most used programs to perform
	this task are LILO, the older of the two, and GRUB, its modern
	replacement. Isolinux and Syslinux are alternatives frequently

        <title><emphasis>CULTURE</emphasis> Uses of partitioning</title>

	<para>Partitioning, an indispensable step in installation, consists
	in dividing the available space on the hard drives (each
	subdivision thereof being called a “partition”) according to
	the data to be stored on it and the use for which the computer is
	intended. This step also includes choosing the filesystems to be
	used. All of these decisions will have an influence on performance,
	data security, and the administration of the server.</para>
      </sidebar>

      <para>The partitioning step is traditionally difficult for new users.
      It is necessary to define the various portions of the disks (or
      “partitions”) on which the Linux filesystems and virtual memory
      (swap) will be stored. This task is complicated if another operating
      system that you want to keep is already on the machine. Indeed, you
      will then have to make sure that you do not alter its partitions (or
      that you resize them without causing damage).</para>

      <para>Fortunately, the partitioning software has a “guided” mode
      which recommends partitions for the user to make — in most cases,
      you can simply validate the software's suggestions.</para>

      <figure>
        <title>Choice of partitioning mode</title>

          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </figure>

      <para>The first screen in the partitioning tool offers the choice of
      using an entire hard drive to create various partitions. For a (new)
      computer which will solely use Linux, this option is clearly the
      simplest, and you can choose the option “Guided - use entire
      disk”. If the computer has two hard drives for two operating
      systems, setting one drive for each is also a solution that can
      facilitate partitioning. In both of these cases, the next screen
      offers to choose the disk where Linux will be installed by selecting
      the corresponding entry (for example, “SCSI1 (0,0,0) (sda) - 12.9
      GB ATA VBOX HARDDISK”). You then start guided partitioning.</para>

      <para>Guided partitioning can also set up LVM logical volumes instead
      of partitions (see below). Since the remainder of the operation is
      the same, we will not go over the option “Guided - use entire disk
      and set up LVM” (encrypted or not).</para>

      <para>In other cases, when Linux must work alongside other already
      existing partitions, you need to choose manual partitioning.</para>

        <indexterm><primary>partitioning</primary><secondary>guided partitioning</secondary></indexterm>

	<para>The guided partitioning tool offers three partitioning
	methods, which correspond to different usages.</para>

            </imageobject>
          </mediaobject>
        </figure>

	<para>The first method is called “All files in one partition”. The
	entire Linux system tree is stored in a single filesystem,
	corresponding to the root <filename>/</filename> directory. This
	simple and robust partitioning fits perfectly for personal or
	single-user systems. In fact, two partitions will be created: the
	first will house the complete system, the second the virtual memory
	(swap).</para>

	<para>The second method, “Separate <filename>/home/</filename>
	partition”, is similar, but splits the file hierarchy in two: one
	partition contains the Linux system (<filename>/</filename>), and
	the second contains “home directories” (meaning user data, in
	files and subdirectories available under
	<filename>/home/</filename>).</para>

	<para>The last partitioning method, called “Separate
	<filename>/home</filename>, <filename>/usr</filename>,
	<filename>/var</filename>, and <filename>/tmp</filename>
	partitions”, is appropriate for servers and multi-user systems.
	It divides the file tree into many partitions: in addition to the
	root (<filename>/</filename>) and user accounts
	(<filename>/home/</filename>) partitions, it also has partitions
	for applications (<filename>/usr/</filename>), server software data
	(<filename>/var/</filename>), and temporary files
	(<filename>/tmp/</filename>). These divisions have several
	advantages. Users can not lock up the server by consuming all
	available hard drive space (they can only fill up
	<filename>/tmp/</filename> and <filename>/home/</filename>). The
	daemon data (especially logs) can no longer clog up the rest of the
	system.</para>

	  <para>A filesystem defines the way in which data is
	  organized on the hard drive. Each existing filesystem has
	  its merits and limitations. Some are more robust, others
	  more effective: if you know your needs well, choosing the
	  most appropriate filesystem is possible. Various comparisons
	  have already been made; it seems that ReiserFS is
	  particularly efficient for reading many small files;
	  <emphasis>XFS</emphasis>, in turn, works faster with large
	  files. <emphasis>Ext4</emphasis>, the default filesystem for
	  Debian, is a good compromise, based on the three previous
	  versions of filesystems historically used in Linux
	  (<emphasis>ext</emphasis>, <emphasis>ext2</emphasis> and
	  <emphasis>ext3</emphasis>). <emphasis>Ext4</emphasis>
	  overcomes certain limitations of <emphasis>ext3</emphasis>
	  and is particularly appropriate for very large capacity hard
	  drives.  Another option would be to experiment with the very
	  promising <emphasis>btrfs</emphasis>, which includes
	  numerous features that require, to this day, the use of LVM
	  and/or RAID.</para>

	  <para>A journalized filesystem (such as
	  <emphasis>ext3</emphasis>, <emphasis>ext4</emphasis>,
	  <emphasis>btrfs</emphasis>, <emphasis>reiserfs</emphasis>, or
	  <emphasis>xfs</emphasis>) takes special measures to make it
	  possible to return to a prior consistent state after an abrupt
	  interruption without completely analyzing the entire disk (as was
	  the case with the <emphasis>ext2</emphasis> system). This
	  functionality is carried out by filling in a journal that
	  describes the operations to conduct prior to actually executing
	  them. If an operation is interrupted, it will be possible to
	  “replay” it from the journal. Conversely, if an interruption
	  occurs during an update of the journal, the last requested change
	  is simply ignored; the data being written could be lost, but
	  since the data on the disk has not changed, they have remained
	  coherent. This is nothing more nor less than a transactional
	  mechanism applied to the filesystem.</para>
        </sidebar>

	<para>After choosing the type of partition, the software calculates
	a suggestion, and describes it on the screen; the user can then
	modify it if needed. You can, in particular, choose another
	filesystem if the standard choice (<emphasis>ext4</emphasis>) isn't
	appropriate. In most cases, however, the proposed partitioning is
	reasonable and it can be accepted by selecting the “Finish
	partitioning and write changes to disk” entry.</para>

	  <para>To install Debian alongside an existing operating system

	  means shrinking a Windows partition and reusing the freed
	  space.</para>

	  <para>The Debian installer allows this operation when using the

	<para>Some types of RAID allow the duplication of information

	hardware problem affecting one of them. Level 1 RAID keeps a
	simple, identical copy (mirror) of a hard drive on another drive,
	while level 5 RAID splits redundant data over several disks, thus
	allowing the complete reconstruction of a failing drive.</para>

	<para>We will only describe level 1 RAID, which is the simplest to
	implement. The first step involves creating two partitions of
	identical size located on two different hard drives, and to label
	them “physical volume for RAID”.</para>

	<para>You must then choose “Configure software RAID” in the
	partitioning tool to combine these two partitions into a new
	virtual disk and select “Create MD device” in the configuration
	screen. You then need to answer a series of questions about this
	new device. The first question asks about the RAID level to use,
	which in our case will be “RAID1”. The second question asks
	about the number of active devices — two in our case, which is
	the number of partitions that needs to be included in this MD
	device. The third question is about the number of spare devices —
	0; we have not planned any additional disk to take over for a
	possible defective disk. The last question requires you to choose
	the partitions for the RAID device — these would be the two
	that we have set aside for this purpose (make sure you only select
	the partitions that explicitly mention “raid”).</para>

	<para>Back to the main menu, a new virtual “RAID” disk appears.

	their cumulative volume, and you can resize existing
	partitions at any time, possibly after adding an additional
	disk when needed.</para>

	<para>LVM uses a particular terminology: a virtual partition is a
	“logical volume”, which is part of a “volume group”, or an
	association of several “physical volumes”. Each of these terms
	in fact corresponds to a “real” partition (or a software RAID

	<para>This technique works in a very simple way: each volume,
	whether physical or logical, is split into blocks of the same size,
	which are made to correspond by LVM. The addition of a new disk
	will cause the creation of a new physical volume, and these new
	blocks can be associated to any volume group. All of the partitions
	in the volume group that is thus expanded will have additional
	space into which they can extend.</para>

	<para>The partitioning tool configures LVM in several
	steps. First you must create on the existing disks the
	partitions that will be “physical volumes for LVM”. To
	activate LVM, you need to choose “Configure the Logical Volume
	Manager (LVM)”, then on the same configuration screen “Create
	a volume group”, to which you will associate the existing
	physical volumes. Finally, you can create logical volumes
	within this volume group. Note that the automatic partitioning
	system can perform all these steps automatically.</para>

	<para>In the partitioning menu, each physical volume will appear as
	a disk with a single partition which can not be deleted, but that

	  <para>When an encrypted partition is used, the encryption key is

        </sidebar>

	<para>To create an encrypted partition, you must first assign an
	available partition for this purpose. To do so, select a partition
	and indicate that it is to be used as a “physical volume for
	encryption”. After partitioning the disk containing the physical
	volume to be made, choose “Configure encrypted volumes”. The
	software will then propose to initialize the physical volume with
	random data (making the localization of the real data more
	difficult), and will ask you to enter an “encryption
	passphrase”, which you will have to enter every time you boot
	your computer in order to access the content of the encrypted
	partition. Once this step has been completed, and you have returned
	to the partitioning tool menu, a new partition will be available in
	an “encrypted volume”, which you can then configure just like
	any other partition. In most cases, this partition is used as a
	physical volume for LVM so as to protect several partitions (LVM
	logical volumes) with the same encryption key, including the swap
	partition (see sidebar).</para>

      <indexterm><primary>system</primary><secondary>base</secondary></indexterm>

      <para>This step, which doesn't require any user interaction, installs
      the Debian “base system” packages. This includes the
      <command>dpkg</command> and <command>apt</command> tools, which
      manage Debian packages, as well as the utilities necessary to boot
      the system and start using it.</para>

      <indexterm><primary>APT</primary><secondary>initial configuration</secondary></indexterm>

      <para>In order to be able to install additional software, APT needs
      to be configured and told where to find Debian packages. This step is
      as automated as possible. It starts with a question asking if it must
      use a network source for packages, or if it should only look for
      packages on the CD-ROM.</para>

      <sidebar>
        <title><emphasis>NOTE</emphasis> Debian CD-ROM in the drive</title>

	<para>If the installer detects a Debian installation disk in the
	CD/DVD reader, it is not necessary to configure APT to go looking
	for packages on the network: APT is automatically configured to
	read packages from a removable media drive. If the disk is part of
	a set, the software will offer to “explore” other disks in
	order to reference all of the packages stored on them.</para>
      </sidebar>

      <para>If getting packages from the network is requested, the next two
      questions allow to choose a server from which to download these
      packages, by choosing first a country, then a mirror available
      in that country (a mirror is a public server hosting copies of all
      the files of the Debian master archive).</para>

      </figure>

      <para>Finally, the program proposes to use an HTTP proxy. If there is
      no proxy, Internet access will be direct. If you type
      <literal>http://proxy.falcot.com:3128</literal>, APT will use the
      Falcot <foreignphrase>proxy/cache</foreignphrase>, a “Squid”
      program. You can find these settings by checking the configurations
      of a web browser on another machine connected to the same
      network.</para>

      <para>The files <filename>Packages.gz</filename> and
      <filename>Sources.gz</filename> are then automatically downloaded to
      update the list of packages recognized by APT.</para>

        <indexterm><primary>Squid</primary></indexterm>

	<para>An HTTP proxy is a server that forwards an HTTP request for
	network users. It sometimes helps to speed up downloads by keeping
	a copy of files that have been transferred through it (we then
	speak of proxy/cache). In some cases, it is the only means of
	accessing an external web server; in such cases it is essential to
	answer the corresponding question during installation for the
	program to be able to download the Debian packages through
	it.</para>

	<para>Squid is the name of the server software used by Falcot Corp
	to offer this service.</para>

      <title>Debian Package Popularity Contest</title>

      <para>The Debian system contains a package called <emphasis
      role="pkg">popularity-contest</emphasis>, whose purpose is to compile
      package usage statistics. Each week, this program collects
      information on the packages installed and those used recently, and
      anonymously sends this information to the Debian project servers. The
      project can then use this information to determine the relative
      importance of each package, which influences the priority that will
      be granted to them. In particular, the most “popular” packages
      will be included in the installation CD-ROM, which will facilitate
      their access for users who do not wish to download them or to
      purchase a complete set.</para>

      <para>This package is only activated on demand, out of respect for

      <title>Selecting Packages for Installation</title>

      <para>The following step allows you to choose the purpose of the

      lists of packages to be installed. The list of the packages that will
      actually be installed will be fine-tuned and completed later on, but
      this provides a good starting point in a simple manner.</para>

      <para>Some packages are also automatically installed according to the
      hardware detected (thanks to the program
      <command>discover-pkginstall</command> from the <emphasis
      role="pkg">discover</emphasis> package). For instance, if a
      VirtualBox virtual machine is detected, the program will install the
      <emphasis role="pkg">virtualbox-ose-guest-dkms</emphasis> package,
      allowing for better integration of the virtual machine with the host
      system.</para>

      <title>Installing the GRUB Bootloader</title>

      <indexterm><primary>bootloader</primary></indexterm>
      <indexterm><primary>GRUB</primary></indexterm>

      <para>The bootloader is the first program started by the BIOS. This
      program loads the Linux kernel into memory and then executes it. It
      often offers a menu that allows the user to choose the kernel to load
      and/or the operating system to boot.</para>

      <sidebar>
        <title><emphasis>BEWARE</emphasis> Bootloader and dual boot</title>
        <indexterm><primary>dual boot</primary></indexterm>

	<para>This phase in the Debian installation process detects the
	operating systems that are already installed on the computer, and
	automatically adds corresponding entries in the boot menu, but not
	all installation programs do this.</para>

	<para>In particular, if you install (or reinstall) Windows
	thereafter, the bootloader will be erased. Debian will still be on
	the hard drive, but will no longer be accessible from the boot
	menu. You would then have to boot the Debian installation system in
	<userinput>rescue</userinput> mode to set up a less exclusive
	bootloader. This operation is described in detail in the
	installation manual. <ulink type="block"
	url="http://www.debian.org/releases/stable/i386/ch08s07.html"/></para>
      </sidebar>

      <para>By default, the menu proposed by GRUB contains all the
      installed Linux kernels, as well as any other operating systems
      that were detected. This is why you should accept the offer to
      install it in the Master Boot Record. Since keeping older kernel
      versions preserves the ability to boot the same system if the
      most recently installed kernel is defective or poorly adapted to
      the hardware, it often makes sense to keep a few older kernel
      versions installed.</para>

      <para>GRUB is the default bootloader installed by Debian thanks to
      its technical superiority: it works with most filesystems and
      therefore doesn't require an update after each installation of a new
      kernel, since it reads its configuration during boot and finds the
      exact position of the new kernel. Version 1 of GRUB (now known as
      “Grub Legacy”) couldn't handle all combinations of LVM and
      software RAID; version 2, installed by default, is more complete.
      There may still be situations where it is more recommendable to
      install LILO (another bootloader); the installer will suggest it
      automatically.</para>

      <para>For more information on configuring GRUB, please refer to <xref
      linkend="sect.config-grub"/>.</para>

      <sidebar role="important">

      <title>Installing Additional Software</title>

      <para>The installed packages correspond to the profiles selected
      during installation, but not necessarily to the use that will
      actually be made of the machine. As such, you might want to use a
      package management tool to refine the selection of installed
      packages. The two most frequently used tools (which are installed if
      the “Graphical desktop environment” profile was chosen) are
      <command>apt</command> (accessible from the command line) and
      <command>synaptic</command> (<menuchoice><guimenu>System</guimenu>
      <guisubmenu>Administration</guisubmenu> <guimenuitem>Synaptic Package
      Manager</guimenuitem></menuchoice>).</para>

      <para>To facilitate the installation of coherent groups of programs,
      Debian creates “tasks” that are dedicated to specific uses (mail
      server, file server, etc.). You already had the opportunity to select
      them during installation, and you can access them again thanks to
      package management tools such as <command>aptitude</command> (the
      tasks are listed in a distinct section) and
      <command>synaptic</command> (through the menu <menuchoice>
      <guimenu>Edit</guimenu> <guimenuitem>Mark Packages by
      Task…</guimenuitem> </menuchoice>).</para>

      <para>Aptitude is an interface to APT in full-screen text mode. It
      allows the user to browse the list of available packages according to
      various categories (installed or not-installed packages, by task, by
      section, etc.), and to view all of the information available on each
      of them (dependencies, conflicts, description, etc.). Each package
      can be marked “install” (to be installed, <keycap>+</keycap> key)
      or “remove” (to be removed, <keycap>-</keycap> key). All of these
      operations will be conducted simultaneously once you've confirmed
      them by pressing the <keycap>g</keycap> key (“g” for “go!”).
      If you have forgotten some programs, no worries; you will be able to
      run <command>aptitude</command> again once the initial installation
      has been completed.</para>
