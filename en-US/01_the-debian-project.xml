      <title><emphasis>CULTURE</emphasis> Origin of the Debian name</title>

      <para>Look no further: Debian is not an acronym. This name is, in
      reality, a contraction of two first names: that of Ian Murdock, and
      his girlfriend at the time, Debra. Debra + Ian = Debian.</para>
    </sidebar>

    <para>Debian is a GNU/Linux and GNU/kFreeBSD distribution. We will
    discuss what a distribution is in further detail in <xref
    linkend="sect.role-of-distributions"/>, but for now, we will simply
    state that it is a complete operating system, including software and
    systems for installation and management, all based on the Linux or
    FreeBSD kernel and free software (especially those from the GNU
    project).</para>

    <para>When he created Debian, in 1993, under the leadership of the FSF,
    Ian Murdock had clear objectives, which he expressed in the
    <emphasis>Debian Manifesto</emphasis>. The free operating system that
    he sought would have to have two principal features. First, quality:
    Debian would be developed with the greatest care, to be worthy of the
    Linux kernel. It would also be a non-commercial distribution,
    sufficiently credible to compete with major commercial distributions.
    This double ambition would, in his eyes, only be achieved by opening
    the Debian development process just like that of Linux and the GNU
    project. Thus, peer review would continuously improve the
    product.</para>

      <para>The GNU project is a range of free software developed, or
      sponsored, by the Free Software Foundation (FSF), originated by its
      iconic leader, Dr. Richard M. Stallman. GNU is a recursive acronym,
      standing for “GNU is Not Unix”.</para>

      <para><acronym>FSF</acronym>'s founder and author of the GPL license,
      Richard M. Stallman (often referred to by his initials, RMS) is a
      charismatic leader of the Free Software movement. Due to his

      non-technical contributions to Free Software (in particular at the
      legal and philosophical level) are respected by everybody.</para>

	<para>Ian Murdock, founder of the Debian project, was its first
	leader, from 1993 to 1996. After passing the baton to Bruce Perens,
	Ian took a less public role. He returned to working behind the
	scenes of the free software community, creating the Progeny
	company, with the intention of marketing a distribution derived
	from Debian. This venture was, sadly, a commercial failure, and
	development was abandoned. The company, after several years of scraping
	by, simply as a service provider, eventually filed for bankruptcy
	in April of 2007. Of the various projects initiated by Progeny,
	only <emphasis>discover</emphasis> still remains. It is an
	automatic hardware detection tool.</para>
      </sidebar>

      <para>Debian, remaining true to its initial principles, has had so
      much success that, today, it has reached a tremendous size. The
      13 architectures offered cover 11 hardware architectures and 2
      kernels (Linux and FreeBSD). Furthermore, with more than 17,300
      source packages, the available software can meet almost any need that
      one could have, whether at home or in the enterprise.</para>

      <para>The sheer size of the distribution can be inconvenient: it
      is really unreasonable to distribute 70 CD-ROMs to install a complete
      version on a standard PC… This is why Debian is increasingly considered
      as a “meta-distribution”, from which one extracts
      more specific distributions intended for a particular public:
      Debian-Desktop for traditional office use, Debian-Edu for education
      and pedagogical use in an academic environment, Debian-Med for
      medical applications, Debian-Junior for young children, etc. A more
      complete list of the subprojects can be found in the section dedicated to that purpose,
      see <xref linkend="sect.sub-projects"/>.</para>

      <para>These partials views of Debian are organized in a well-defined framework, thus
      guaranteeing hassle-free compatibility between the various
      “sub-distributions”. All of them follow the general planning for
      release of new versions. And since they build on the same foundations, they can be
      easily extended, completed, and personalized with applications
      available in the Debian repositories.</para>
      <indexterm><primary>subproject</primary></indexterm>

      <para>All the Debian tools operate in this direction:
      <command>debian-cd</command> has for a long time now allowed the
      creation of a set of CD-ROMs containing only a pre-selected set
      of packages;
      <command>debian-installer</command> is also a modular installer,
      easily adapted to special needs. <command>APT</command> will install
      packages from various origins, while guaranteeing the overall
      consistency of the system.</para>

	<para>The term “architecture” indicates a type of computer (the
	most known include Mac or PC). Each architecture is differentiated
	primarily according to its processor, usually incompatible with
	other processors. These differences in hardware involve varying
	means of operation, thus requiring that software be compiled
	specifically for each architecture.</para>

	<para>Most software available in Debian is written in portable
	programming languages: the same source code can be compiled for various
	architectures. In effect, an executable binary, always compiled for
	a specific architecture, will not usually function on the other
	architectures.</para>

	<para>Recall that each program is created by writing source code;
	this source code is a text file composed of instructions in a given
	programming language. Before you can use the software, it is
	necessary to compile the source code, which means transforming the
	code into a binary (a series of machine instructions executable by
	the processor). Each programming language has a specific compiler
	to execute this operation (for example, <command>gcc</command> for
	the C programming language).</para>

      <title>The Quality of Free Software</title>

      <para>Debian follows all of the principles of Free Software, and its
      new versions are not released until they are ready. Developers are
      not forced by some set schedule to rush to meet an arbitrary
      deadline. People frequently complain of the long time between
      Debian's stable releases, but this caution also ensures Debian's
      legendary reliability: long months of testing are indeed necessary
      for the full distribution to receive the “stable” label.</para>

      <para>Debian will not compromise on quality: all known critical bugs
      are resolved in any new version, even if this requires the initially
      forecast release date to be pushed back.</para>

      <para>Debian does not exclude any category of users, however
      small the minority. Its historical installation program, known
      as <command>boot-floppies</command>, was known to be rough
      around the edges, because it was the only one able to operate on
      all of the architectures on which the Linux kernel runs, and the
      project didn't want to simply replace it with a program that was
      more user-friendly, but limited to only the PC (i386
      architecture). Fortunately, those days are long gone, and
      <command>debian-installer</command> is now a mature installer,
      versatile enough for the extended needs of the project.</para>

    <section>
      <title>The Legal Framework: A Non-Profit Organization</title>

      <para>Legally speaking, Debian is a project managed by an American
      not-for-profit, volunteer association. The project has around a thousand
      <emphasis>Debian developers</emphasis>, but brings together a far
      greater number of contributors (translators, bug reporters, artists,
      casual developers, etc.).</para>

      <para>To carry its mission to fruition, Debian has a large
      infrastructure, with many servers connected across the Internet,
      offered by many sponsors.</para>

        <indexterm><primary>Software in the Public Interest</primary></indexterm>

	<para>Debian doesn't own any server in its own name, since it
	is only a project within the <emphasis>Software in the Public
	Interest</emphasis> association, and SPI manages the hardware
	and financial aspects (donations, purchase of hardware,
	etc.). While initially created specifically for the Debian
	project, this association now has a hand in other free
	software projects, especially the PostgreSQL database,
	Freedesktop.org (project for standardization of various parts
	of modern graphical desktop environments, such as GNOME and
	KDE), and the Libre Office office suite. <ulink type="block"
	url="http://www.spi-inc.org/"/></para>

	<para>In addition to SPI, various local associations
	collaborate closely with Debian in order to generate funds for
	Debian, without centralizing everything in the U.S.A. This
	setup avoids prohibitive international transfer costs, and
	fits well with the decentralized nature of the project. Such
	associations include <emphasis>Debian France</emphasis>,
	<emphasis>FFIS</emphasis> (in Germany), <emphasis>Associazione

    <title>The Foundation Documents</title>

    <para><indexterm><primary>Foundation
    Documents</primary></indexterm> A few years after its initial
    launch, Debian formalized the principles that it should follow as
    a free software project. This deliberately activist decision
    allows orderly and peaceful growth by ensuring that all members
    progress in the same direction. To become a Debian developer, any
    candidate must confirm and prove their support and adherence to
    the principles established in the project's Foundation
    Documents.</para>

    <para>The development process is constantly debated, but these
    Foundation Documents are widely and consensually supported, thus
    rarely change. The Debian constitution also offers other
    guarantees for their stability: a three-quarters qualified
    majority is required to approve any amendment.</para>

      <title>The Commitment towards Users</title>
      <indexterm><primary>social contract</primary></indexterm>
      <indexterm><primary>contract, social</primary></indexterm>

      <para>The project also has a “social contract”. What place does
      such a text have in a project only intended for the development of an
      operating system? That is quite simple: Debian works for its users,
      and thus, by extension, for society. This contract summarizes the
      commitments that the project undertakes. Let us study them in greater
      detail:</para>

      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
	  <para>Debian will remain 100% free.</para>

	  <para>This is Rule No. 1. Debian is and will remain composed
	  entirely and exclusively of free software. Additionally, all
	  software development within the Debian project, itself, will be
	  free.</para>

          <sidebar>
            <title><emphasis>PERSPECTIVE</emphasis> Beyond software</title>

	    <para>The first version of the Debian Social Contract said
	    “Debian Will Remain 100% Free
	    <emphasis>Software</emphasis>”. The disappearance of this
	    word (with the ratification of Version 1.1 of the contract in
	    April of 2004) indicates the will to achieve freedom, not only
	    in software, but also in the documentation and any other
	    element that Debian wishes to provide within its operating
	    system.</para>

	    <para>This change, which was only intended as editorial,
	    has, in reality, had numerous consequences, especially
	    with the removal of some problematic documentation.
	    Furthermore, the increasing use of firmware in drivers
	    poses problems: despite often being non-free, they are,
	    nonetheless, necessary for proper operation of the
	    corresponding hardware.</para>
          </sidebar>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
	  <para>We will give back to the free software community.</para>

	  <para>Any improvement contributed by the Debian project to a
	  work integrated in the distribution is sent back to the author
	  of the work (called “upstream”). In general, Debian will
	  cooperate with the community rather than work in
	  isolation.</para>

          <sidebar>
            <title><emphasis>COMMUNITY</emphasis> Upstream author, or Debian developer?</title>
            <indexterm><primary>upstream author</primary></indexterm>
            <indexterm><primary>author, upstream</primary></indexterm>
            <indexterm><primary>upstream</primary></indexterm>

	    <para>The term “upstream author” means the
	    author(s)/developer(s) of a work, those who write and
	    develop it. On the other hand, a “Debian developer” uses
	    an existing work to make it into a Debian package (the
	    term “Debian maintainer” is better suited).</para>

	    <para>In practice, the distinction is often not as
	    clear-cut.  The Debian maintainer may write a patch, which
	    benefits all users of the work. In general, Debian
	    encourages those in charge of a package in Debian to get
	    involved in “upstream” development as well (they become,
	    then, contributors, without being confined to the role of
	    simple users of a program).</para>
          </sidebar>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
	  <para>We will not hide problems.</para>

	  <para>Debian is not perfect, and, we will find new problems to
	  fix every day. We will keep our entire bug report database open
	  for public view at all times. Reports that people file on-line
	  will promptly become visible to others.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
	  <para>Our priorities are our users and free software.</para>

	  <para>This commitment is more difficult to define. Debian
	  imposes, thus, a bias when a decision must be made, and will
	  discard an easy solution for the developers that will jeopardize
	  the user experience, opting for a more elegant solution, even if
	  it is more difficult to implement. This means to take into
	  account, as a priority, the interests of the users and free
	  software.</para>

          
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
	  <para>Works that do not meet our free software standards.</para>

	  <para>Debian accepts and understands that users may want to use
	  some non-free programs. That's why the project allows usage of parts
	  of its infrastructure to distribute Debian packages of non-free
	  software that can safely be redistributed.</para>

            <indexterm><primary>section</primary><secondary>non-free</secondary></indexterm>

	    <para>The commitment to maintain a structure to accommodate
	    non-free software (i.e. the “non-free” section, see the
	    sidebar <xref linkend="sidebar.sections"/>) is frequently a
	    subject of debate within the Debian community.</para>

	    <para>Detractors argue that it turns people away from free
	    software equivalents, and contradicts the principle of serving
	    only the free software cause. Supporters flatly state that most
	    of the non-free packages are “nearly free”, and held back
	    by only one or two annoying restrictions (the most common being
	    the prohibition against commercial usage of the software). By
	    distributing these works in the non-free branch, we
	    indirectly explain to the author that their creation would be
	    better known and more widely used if they could be included in
	    the main section. They are, thus, politely invited to alter
	    their license to serve this purpose.</para>

	    <para>After a first, unfruitful attempt in 2004, the complete
	    removal of the non-free section should not return to the agenda
	    for several years, especially since it contains many useful
	    documents that were moved simply because they did not meet the
	    new requirements for the main section. This is especially the
	    case for certain software documentation files issued by the GNU
	    project (in particular, Emacs and Make).</para>

	    <para>The continued existence of the non-free section is a
	    source of occasional friction with the Free Software
	    Foundation, and is the main reason it refuses to
	    officially recommend Debian as an operating system.</para>

	    <para>The GNU GPL, the BSD license, and the Artistic License
	    all comply with the Debian Free Software Guidelines, even
	    though they are very different.</para>

	    <para>The GNU GPL, used and promoted by the FSF (Free Software
	    Foundation), is the most common. Its main feature is that
	    it also applies to any derived work that is redistributed:
	    a program incorporating or using GPL code can only be
	    distributed according to its terms. It prohibits, thus, any
	    reuse in a proprietary application. This poses serious problems
	    for the reuse of GPL code in free software incompatible with
	    this license. As such, it is sometimes impossible to link a
	    program published under another free software license with a
	    library distributed under the GPL. On the other hand, this
	    license is very solid in American law: FSF lawyers have
	    participated in the drafting thereof, and have often forced
	    violators to reach an amicable agreement with the FSF without
	    going to court. <ulink type="block"
	    url="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html"/></para>

	    <para>The BSD license is the least restrictive: everything is
	    permitted, including use of modified BSD code in a proprietary
	    application. Microsoft even uses it, basing the TCP/IP layer of
	    Windows NT on that of the BSD kernel. <ulink type="block"
	    url="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php"/></para>

	    <para>Finally, the Artistic License reaches a compromise
	    between these two others: integration of code in a proprietary
	    application is permitted, but any modification must be
	    published. <ulink type="block"
	    url="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/artistic-license-2.0.php"/></para>

	    <para>Copyleft is a principle that consists in using copyrights
	    to guarantee the freedom of a work and its derivatives, rather
	    than restrict the rights of uses, as is the case with
	    proprietary software. It is, also, a play of words on the term
	    “copyright”. Richard Stallman discovered the idea when a
	    friend of his, fond of puns, wrote on an envelope addressed to
	    him: “copyleft: all rights reversed”. Copyleft imposes
	    preservation of all initial liberties upon distribution of an
	    original or modified version of a work (usually a program). It is, thus, not
	    possible to distribute a program as proprietary software if it
	    is derived from code from a copyleft released program.</para>

	    <para>The most well-known family of copyleft licenses is,
	    of course, the GNU GPL and its derivatives, the GNU LGPL
	    or GNU Lesser General Public License, and the GNU FDL or
	    GNU Free Documentation License. Sadly, the copyleft
	    licenses are generally incompatible with each
	    other. Consequently, it is best to use only one of
	    them.</para>

	<para>Maintaining a package entails, first, “packaging” a

	installation so that, once installed, this program will operate and
	comply with the rules the Debian project sets for itself.
	The result of this operation is saved in a
	<filename>.deb</filename> file. Effective installation of the
	program will then require nothing more than extraction of this
	compressed archive and execution of some pre-installation or
	post-installation scripts contained therein.</para>

	<para>After this initial phase, the maintenance cycle truly begins:
	preparing updates to follow the latest version of the Debian
	Policy, fixing bugs reported by users, and including new
	“upstream” versions of the program which naturally continues to
	develop simultaneously.  For instance, at the time of the initial packaging,
	the program was at version 1.2.3. After some months of development,
	the original authors release a new stable version, numbered 
	1.4.0. At this point, the Debian maintainer should update the

      Debian remains consistent despite its gigantic size. This Policy is
      not fixed in stone, but continuously evolves thanks to proposals
      formulated on the <email>debian-policy@lists.debian.org</email>
      mailing list. Amendments that are agreed upon by all interested parties are accepted and
      applied to the text by a small group of maintainers who have no
      editorial responsibility (they only include the modifications agreed
      upon by the Debian developers that are members of the above-mentioned
      list). You can read current amendment proposals on the bug tracking

	<para>Anyone can propose an amendment to the Debian Policy just by

	The process that then starts is documented in
	<filename>/usr/share/doc/debian-policy/Process.html</filename>: if
	it is acknowledged that the problem revealed must be resolved by
	creating a new rule in the Debian Policy, a discussion 
	begins on the <email>debian-policy@lists.debian.org</email> mailing
	list until consensus is reached and a proposal issued. Someone
	then drafts a desired amendment and submits it for approval (in
	the form of a patch to review). As soon as two other developers
	approve the fact that the proposed amendment reflects the consensus
	reached in the previous discussion (they “second” it), the
	proposal can be included in the official document by one of the
	<emphasis role="pkg">debian-policy</emphasis> package maintainers.
	If the process fails at one of these steps, the maintainers close
	the bug, classifying the proposal as rejected.</para>

      <para>The Policy covers very well the technical aspects of packaging.
      The size of the project also raises organizational problems; these

      <para>This constitution defines a certain number of roles and
      positions, plus responsibilities and authorities for each. It is
      particularly worth noting that Debian developers always have ultimate
      decision making authority by a vote of general resolution, wherein a
      qualified majority of three quarters (75%) of votes is required for
      significant alterations to be made (such as those with an impact on
      the Foundation Documents). However, developers annually elect a
      “leader” to represent them in meetings, and ensure internal
      coordination between varying teams. This election is always a period
      of intense discussions. This leader's role is not formally defined by
      any document: candidates for this post usually propose their own
      definition of the position. In practice, the leader's roles include
      serving as a representative to the media, coordinating between
      “internal” teams, and providing overall guidance to the project,
      within which the developers can relate: the views of the DPL are
      implicitly approved by the majority of project members.</para>

      <para>Specifically, the leader has real authority; his vote resolves
      tie votes; he can make any decision which is not already under the
      authority of someone else and can delegate part of his

	<para>A “flamewar” is an exceedingly impassioned debate, which
	frequently ends up with people attacking each other once all
	reasonable argumentation has been exhausted on both
	sides. Certain themes are more frequently subject to polemics
	than others (the choice of text editor, “do you prefer
	<command>vi</command> or <command>emacs</command>?”, is an old
	favorite). The matters often provoke very rapid e-mail
	exchanges due to the sheer number of people with an opinion on
	the matter (everyone) and the very personal nature of such
	questions.</para>

	<para>Nothing particularly useful generally comes from such
	discussions; the general recommendation is to stay out of such
	debates, and maybe rapidly skim through their content, since
	reading them in full would be too time-consuming.</para>
      </sidebar>

      <para>Even if this constitution establishes a semblance of
      democracy, the daily reality is quite different: Debian
      naturally follows the free software rules of the do-ocracy: the
      one who does things gets to decide how to do them. A lot of time
      can be wasted debating the respective merits of various ways to
      approach a problem; the chosen solution will be the first one
      that is both functional and satisfying… which will come out of
      the time that a competent person did put into it.</para>

      <para>This is the only way to earn one's stripes: do something
      useful and show that one has worked well. Many Debian
      “administrative” teams operate by appointment, preferring
      volunteers who have already effectively contributed and proved their
      competence. This method is practical, because the most of the work
      these teams do is public, therefore, accessible to any interested
      developer. This is why Debian is often described as a
      “meritocracy”.</para>

      <sidebar>
        <title><emphasis>CULTURE</emphasis> Meritocracy, the reign of knowledge</title>
        <indexterm><primary>meritocracy</primary></indexterm>

	<para>Meritocracy is a form of government in which authority is
	exercised by those with the greatest merit. For Debian, merit is a
	measure of competence, which is, itself, assessed by observation of
	past actions by one or more others within the project (Stefano
	Zacchiroli, the current project leader, speaks of “do-ocracy”,
	meaning “power to those who get things done”). Their simple
	existence proves a certain level of competence; their achievements
	generally being free software, with available source code, which
	can easily be reviewed by peers to assess their quality.</para>
      </sidebar>

      <para>This effective operational method guarantees the quality of
      contributors in the “key” Debian teams. This method is by no
      means perfect and occasionally there are those who do not accept this
      way of operating. The selection of developers accepted in the teams
      may appear a bit arbitrary, or even unfair. Furthermore, not
      everybody has the same definition of the service expected from these
      teams. For some, it is unacceptable to have to wait eight days for
      inclusion of a new Debian package, while others will wait patiently
      for three weeks without a problem. As such, there are regular
      complaints from the disgruntled about the “quality of service”
      from some teams.</para>

	<para>The team in charge of admitting new developers is the most
	regularly criticized. One must acknowledge that, throughout the
	years, the Debian project has become more and more demanding of the
	developers that it will accept. Some people may see some injustice
	in that, but we must confess that what were only little challenges
	at the beginning have become much greater in a community of over
	1,000 people, when it comes to ensuring the quality and integrity
	of everything that Debian produces for its users.</para>

	<para>Furthermore, the acceptance procedure is concluded by review
	of the candidacy by a small team, the Debian Account Managers.
	These managers are, thus, particularly exposed to criticism, since
	they have final say in the inclusion or rejection of a volunteer
	within the Debian developers community. In practice, sometimes they
	must delay the acceptance of a person until they have learned more
	about the operations of the project. One can, of course, contribute
	to Debian before being accepted as an official developer, by being
	sponsored by current developers.</para>

      <title>The Active Role of Users</title>

      <para>One might wonder why it is relevant to mention the users
      among those who work within the Debian project, but the answer
      is a definite yes: they play a critical role in the project.
      Far from being “passive”, some of our users run development
      versions of Debian and regularly file bug reports to indicate
      problems. Others go even further and submit ideas for
      improvements, by filing a bug report with a severity level of
      “wishlist”, or even submit corrections to the source code,
      called “patches” (see sidebar <xref
      linkend="sidebar.patch"/>).</para>

	<para>The Debian Bug Tracking System (Debian BTS) is used by
	large parts of the
	project. The public part (the web interface) allows users to view
	all bugs reported, with the option to display a sorted list of bugs
	selected according to various criteria, such as: affected package,
	severity, status, address of the reporter, address of the
	maintainer in charge of it, tag, etc. It is also possible to browse
	the complete historical listing of all discussions regarding each
	of the bugs.</para>

	<para>Below the surface, the Debian BTS communicates via e-mail:
	all information that it stores come from messages sent by the
	various persons involved. Any e-mail sent to
	<email>12345@bugs.debian.org</email> will, thus, be assigned to the
	history for bug no. 12345. Authorized persons may “close” a bug
	by writing a message describing the reasons for the decision to
	close to <email>12345-done@bugs.debian.org</email> (a bug is closed
	when the indicated problem is resolved or no longer relevant). A
	new bug is reported by sending an e-mail to
	<email>submit@bugs.debian.org</email> according to a specific
	format which identifies the package in question. The address
	<email>control@bugs.debian.org</email> allows editing of all the
	“meta-information” related to a bug.</para>

	<para>Debian BTS has other functional features, as well, such as
	the use of tags for labeling bugs. For more information, see <ulink

	<para>The severity of a bug formally assigns a degree of
	gravity to the reported problem. Effectively, not all bugs
	have the same importance; for instance, a typo in a manual
	page is not comparable to a security vulnerability in server
	software.</para>

	<para>Debian uses an extended scale to describe the severity
	of a bug. Each level is defined precisely in order to
	facilitate the selection thereof. <ulink type="block"

      <para>Additionally, numerous satisfied users of the service offered
      by Debian like to make a contribution of their own to the project. As
      not everyone has appropriate levels of expertise in programming, they
      may choose to assist with the translation and review of
      documentation. There are language-specific mailing lists for various
      languages. For French, for instance, it is
      <email>debian-l10n-french@lists.debian.org</email>. <ulink

	preserving the initial and last letter of each word, and the number
	of letters in the middle.</para>

	<para>To “internationalize” a program consists of modifying it
	so that it can be translated (localized). This involves partially
	rewriting a program initially written to work in one language in
	order to be able to open it to all languages.</para>

	<para>To “localize” a program consists of translating the
	original messages (frequently in English) to another language. For

	<para>A patch is a file describing changes to be made to one or

	to be removed or added to the code, as well as (sometimes) lines
	taken from the reference text, replacing the modifications in

	if the line numbers have been changed).</para>

	<para>The tool used for applying the modifications given in such a

        <screen><computeroutput>$ </computeroutput><userinput>diff -u file.old file.new &gt;file.patch</userinput>

	<para>The <command>reportbug</command> tool facilitates sending bug
	reports on a Debian package. It helps making sure the bug in
	question hasn't already been filed, thus preventing redundancy in the
	system. It reminds the user of the definitions of the severity
	levels, for the report to be as accurate as possible (the developer
	can always fine-tune these parameters later, if needed). It helps
	writing a complete bug report without the user needing to know the
	precise syntax, by writing it and allowing the user to edit it.
	This report will then be sent via an e-mail server (local, by
	default, but <command>reportbug</command> can also use a remote
	server).</para>

	<para>This tool first targets the development versions, which
	is where the bugs will be fixed. A stable version of Debian
	is almost as good as written in stone, with very few
	exceptions for security
	updates or other important updates (if, for example, a package is
	not working at all). A correction of a minor bug in a Debian
	package must, thus, wait for the next stable version.</para>
      </sidebar>

      <para>All of these contribution mechanisms are made more
      efficient by users' behavior. Far from being a collection of
      isolated persons, users are a true community within which
      numerous exchanges take place. We especially note the impressive
      activity on the user discussion mailing list,
      <email>debian-user@lists.debian.org</email> (<xref
      linkend="solving-problems"/> discusses this in greater
      detail).</para>

      <para>Not only do users help themselves (and others) on
      technical issues that directly affect them, but they also
      discuss the best ways to contribute to the Debian project and
      help it move forward — discussions that frequently result in
      suggestions for improvements.</para>

      <para>Since Debian does not expend funds on any self-promoting
      marketing campaigns, its users play an essential role in its
      diffusion, ensuring its notoriety via word-of-mouth.</para>

      <para>This method functions quite well, since Debian fans are found
      at all levels of the free software community: from install parties
      (workshops where seasoned users assist newcomers to install the
      system) organized by local LUGs or “Linux User Groups”, to
      association booths at large tech conventions dealing with Linux,
      etc.</para>

      <title>Teams and Sub-Projects</title>

      <para>Debian has been organized, right from the start, around
      the concept of source packages, each with its maintainer or
      group of maintainers. Many work teams have emerged over time,
      ensuring administration of the infrastructure, management of
      tasks not specific to any package in particular (quality
      assurance, Debian Policy, installer, etc.), with the latest
      series of teams growing up around sub-projects.</para>
      <section id="sect.sub-projects">
        <title>Existing Debian Sub-Projects</title>

	<para>To each their own Debian! A sub-project is a group of
	volunteers interested in adapting Debian to specific
	needs. Beyond the selection of a sub-group of programs
	intended for a particular domain (education, medicine,
	multimedia creation, etc.), sub-projects are also involved in
	improving existing packages, packaging missing software,
	adapting the installer, creating specific documentation, and

	  <para>The development process for a derivative distribution
	  consists in starting with a particular version of Debian and
	  making a number of modifications to it. The infrastructure used
	  for this work is completely external to the Debian project. There
	  isn't necessarily a policy for contributing improvements. This
	  difference explains how a derivative distribution may
	  “diverge” from its origins, and why they have to regularly
	  resynchronize with their source in order to benefit from
	  improvements made upstream.</para>

	  <para>On the other hand, a sub-project can not diverge, since all
	  the work on it consists of directly improving Debian in order to
	  adapt it to a specific goal.</para>

	  <para>The most known distribution derived from Debian is, without
	  a doubt, Ubuntu, but there are many. See <xref
	  linkend="derivative-distributions"/> to learn about their
	  particularities and their positioning in relationship to

	  Due to time constraints, it has not progressed further, as is

	  <para>Likewise, a team of Norwegians worked on a similar

	  <para>Agnula was a European project, managed under the direction

	  <para>The bug tracking system, initially designed to

	  Debian package. The “pseudo-packages” allow, thus, certain
	  teams to use the bug tracking system without associating a
	  real package with their team. Everyone can, thus, report
	  issues that needs to be dealt with. For instance, the BTS
	  has a <emphasis>ftp.debian.org</emphasis> entry that is used
	  to report and track problems on the official package archive
	  or simply to request removal of a package. Likewise, the

	programs to meet its goals. Of course, developed under a free
	software license, these tools make use of methods proven elsewhere
	in the free software world.</para>

	  <para>CVS (Concurrent Versions System) is a tool for
	  collaborative work on multiple files, while maintaining a history
	  of modifications. The files in question are generally text files,
	  such as a program's source code. If several people work together
	  on the same file, <command>cvs</command> can only merge the
	  alterations made if they were made to different portions of the
	  file. Otherwise, these “conflicts” must be resolved by hand.
	  This system manages modifications, line by line, by storing diff
	  patches from one version to another.</para>

	  <para>CVS uses a central archive (called a CVS repository) to
	  store files and the history of their modifications (each revision
	  is recorded in the form of a <emphasis>diff</emphasis> patch
	  file, intended to be used on the prior version). Everyone checks
	  out a particular version (working copy) to work on. The tool
	  allows one to view the modifications made to the working copy
	  (<command>cvs diff</command>), to record them in the central
	  repository by creating a new entry in the versions history
	  (<command>cvs commit</command>), to update the working copy to
	  include modifications made in parallel by other uses
	  (<command>cvs update</command>), and to record a particular
	  configuration in the history in order to be able to easily
	  extract it later on (<command>cvs tag</command>).</para>

	  <para><command>CVS</command> experts will know how to handle
	  multiple concurrent versions of a project in development without
	  them interfering with each other. These versions are called
	  <emphasis>branches</emphasis>. This metaphor of a tree is fairly
	  accurate, since a program is initially developed on a common
	  trunk. When a milestone has been reached (such as version 1.0),
	  development continues on two branches: the development branch
	  prepares the next major release, and the maintenance branch
	  manages updates and fixes for version 1.0.</para>

	  <para><command>cvs</command>, however, does have some
	  limitations. It is unable to manage symbolic links, changes in
	  file or directory names, the deletion of directories, etc. It has
	  contributed to the appearance of more modern free
	  alternatives which have filled in most of these gaps. These
	  include, especially, <command>subversion</command>
	  (<command>svn</command>), <command>git</command>,

	<para>Debian has developed little software of its own, but certain
	programs have assumed a starring role, and their fame has spread
	beyond the scope of the project. Good examples are
	<command>dpkg</command>, the Debian package management program (it
	is, in fact, an abbreviation of Debian PacKaGe, and generally
	pronounced as “dee-package”), and
	<command>apt</command>, a tool to automatically install any Debian
	package, and its dependencies, guaranteeing the consistency of the
	system after an upgrade (its name is an acronym for Advanced Package
	Tool). Their teams are, however, much smaller, since a rather high
	level of programming skill is required to gain an overall understanding of
	the operations of these types of programs.</para>

	<para>The most important team is probably that for the Debian
	installation program, <command>debian-installer</command>, which
	has accomplished a work of momentous proportions since its
	conception in 2001. Numerous contributors were needed, since it is
	difficult to write a single program able to install Debian on a
	dozen different architectures. Each one has its own mechanism for
	booting and its own bootloader. All of this work is coordinated on
	the <email>debian-boot@lists.debian.org</email> mailing list, under
	the direction of Joey Hess and Cyril Brulebois. <ulink type="block"
	url="http://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer/"/> <ulink
	type="block"
	url="http://kitenet.net/~joey/blog/entry/d-i_retrospective/"/></para>

	<para>The (very small) <command>debian-cd</command> program team
	has an even more modest objective. Many “small” contributors
	are responsible for their architecture, since the main developer
	can not know all the subtleties, nor the exact way to start the
	installer from the CD-ROM.</para>

	<para>Many teams must collaborate with others in the activity of
	packaging: <email>debian-qa@lists.debian.org</email> tries, for
	example, to ensure quality at all levels of the Debian project. The
	<email>debian-policy@lists.debian.org</email> list develops Debian
	Policy according to proposals from all over the place. The teams in
	charge of each architecture
	(<email>debian-<replaceable>architecture</replaceable>@lists.debian.org</email>)
	compile all packages, adapting them to their particular
	architecture, if needed.</para>

	<para>Other teams manage the most important packages in order to
	ensure maintenance without placing too heavy a load on a single
	pair of shoulders; this is the case with the C library and
	<email>debian-glibc@lists.debian.org</email>, the C compiler on the
	<email>debian-gcc@lists.debian.org</email> list, or Xorg on the
	<email>debian-x@lists.debian.org</email> (this group is also known
	as the X Strike Force, and coordinated by Cyril Brulebois).</para>

    <para>As arleady mentioned, the Debian project evolves in a very
    distributed, very organic way.  As a consequence, it may be
    difficult at times to stay in touch with what happens within the
    project without being overwhelmed with a never-ending flood of
    notifications.</para>

    <para>If you only want the most important news about Debian, you
    probably should subscribe to the
    <email>debian-announce@lists.debian.org</email> list.  This is a
    very low-traffic list (around a dozen messages a year), and only
    gives the most important announcements, such as the availability
    of a new stable release, the election of a new Project Leader, or
    the yearly Debian Conference.</para>

    <indexterm><primary>Debian Project News</primary></indexterm>
    <para>More general (and regular) news about Debian are sent to the
    <email>debian-news@lists.debian.org</email> list.  The traffic on
    this list is quite reasonable too (usually around a handful of
    messages a month), and it includes the semi-regular “Debian
    Project News”, which is a compilation of various small bits of
    information about what happens in the project.  Since all Debian
    developers can contribute these news when they think they have
    something noteworthy to make public, the DPN gives a valuable
    insight while staying rather focused on the project as a whole.
    </para>

    <para>For more information about the evolution of Debian and
    what is happening at some point in time in various teams,
    there's also the
    <email>debian-devel-announce@lists.debian.org</email> list.  As
    its name implies, the announcements it carries will probably be
    more interesting to developers, but it also allows interested
    parties to keep an eye on what happens in more concrete terms
    than just when a stable version is released.  While
    <email>debian-announce</email> gives news about the user-visible
    results, <email>debian-devel-announce</email> gives news about
    how these results are produced.  As a side note, “d-d-a” (as it

    <title>The Role of Distributions</title>
    <indexterm><primary>Linux distribution</primary><secondary>role</secondary></indexterm>

    <para>A GNU/Linux distribution has two main objectives: install a free
    operating system on a computer (either with or without an existing
    system or systems), and provide a range of software covering all of the
    users' needs.</para>
    <section>
      <title>The Installer: <command>debian-installer</command></title>

      
      <para>The <command>debian-installer</command>, designed to be
      extremely modular in order to be as generic as possible, targets the
      first objective. It covers a broad range of installation situations and in
      general, greatly facilitates the creation of a derivative installer
      corresponding to a particular case.</para>

      <para>This modularity, which also makes it very complex, may be
      daunting for the developers discovering this tool; but whether
      used in graphical or text mode, the user's experience is still
      similar. Great efforts have been made to reduce the number of
      questions asked at installation time, in particular thanks to
      the inclusion of automatic hardware detection software.</para>

      <para>It is interesting to note that distributions derived from
      Debian differ greatly on this aspect, and provide a more limited
      installer (often confined to the i386 or amd64 architectures), but more
      user-friendly for the uninitiated. On the other hand, they usually
      refrain from straying too far from package contents in order to
      benefit as much as possible from the vast range of software offered
      without causing compatibility problems.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>The Software Library</title>

      <para>Quantitatively, Debian is undeniably the leader in this
      respect, with over 17,300 source packages. Qualitatively,
      Debian’s policy and long testing period prior to releasing a new
      stable version justify its reputation for stability and
      consistency. As far as availability, everything is available
      on-line through many mirrors worldwide, with updates pushed out
      every six hours.</para>

      <para>Many retailers sell CD-ROMs on the Internet at a very low price
      (often at cost), the “images” for which are freely available for
      download. There is only one drawback: the low frequency of releases
      of new stable versions (their development sometimes takes more than
      two years), which delays the inclusion of new software.</para>

      <para>Most new free software programs quickly find their way into the
      development version which allows them to be installed. If this
      requires too many updates due to their dependencies, the program can
      also be recompiled for the stable version of Debian (see <xref
      linkend="debian-packaging"/> for more information on this
      topic).</para>

    <para>The project will simultaneously have three or four different

    role="distribution">Unstable</emphasis>, <emphasis
    role="distribution">Testing</emphasis>, and <emphasis
    role="distribution">Stable</emphasis>. Each one corresponds to a
    different phase in development. For a good understanding, let us take a
    look at a program's journey, from its initial packaging to inclusion in
    a stable version of Debian.</para>

    <sidebar>
      <title><emphasis>VOCABULARY</emphasis> Release</title>
      <indexterm><primary>release</primary></indexterm>

      <para>The term “release”, in the Debian project, indicates a
      particular version of a distribution (e.g., “unstable release”
      means “the unstable version”). It also indicates the public
      announcement of the launch of any new version (stable).</para>
    </sidebar>
    <section>
      <title>The <emphasis role="distribution">Experimental</emphasis> Status</title>

      <para>First let us take a look at the particular case of the
      <emphasis role="distribution">Experimental</emphasis> distribution:
      this is a group of Debian packages corresponding to the software
      currently in development, and not necessarily completed, explaining
      its name. Not everything passes through this step; some developers
      add packages here in order to get feedback from more experienced (or
      braver) users.</para>

      <para>Otherwise, this distribution frequently houses important
      modifications to base packages, whose integration into <emphasis
      role="distribution">Unstable</emphasis> with serious bugs would
      have critical repercussions. It is, thus, a completely isolated
      distribution, its packages never migrate to another version
      (except by direct, express intervention of the maintainer or the
      ftpmasters).  It is also not self-contained: only a subset of
      the existing packages are present in <emphasis
      role="distribution">Experimental</emphasis>, and it generally
      does not include the base system.  This distribution is
      therefore mostly useful in combination with another,
      self-contained, distribution such as <emphasis
      role="distribution">Unstable</emphasis>.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>The <emphasis role="distribution">Unstable</emphasis> Status</title>

      <para>Let us turn back to the case of a typical package. The
      maintainer creates an initial package, which they compile for
      the <emphasis role="distribution">Unstable</emphasis> version
      and place on the <literal>ftp-master.debian.org</literal>
      server. This first event involves inspection and validation from
      the ftpmasters. The software is then available in the <emphasis
      role="distribution">Unstable</emphasis> distribution, which is
      the “cutting edge” distribution chosen by users who are more
      concerned with having up to date packages than worried about
      serious bugs. They discover the program and then test it.</para>

      <para>If they encounter bugs, they report them to the package's
      maintainer. The maintainer then regularly prepares corrected
      versions, which they upload to the server.</para>

      <para>Every newly updated package is updated on all Debian mirrors
      around the world within six hours. The users then test the
      corrections and search for other problems resulting from the
      modifications. Several updates may then occur rapidly. During these
      times, autobuilder robots come into action. Most frequently, the
      maintainer has only one traditional PC and has compiled his package
      on the amd64 (or i386) architecture; the autobuilders take over and
      automatically compile versions for all the other architectures. Some
      compilations may fail; the maintainer will then receive a bug report
      indicating the problem, which is then to be corrected in the next
      versions. When the bug is discovered by a specialist for the
      architecture in question, the bug report may come with a patch ready
      to use.</para>

      <title>Migration to <emphasis role="distribution">Testing</emphasis></title>

      <para>A bit later, the package will have matured; compiled on all the
      architectures, it will not have undergone recent modifications. It is
      then a candidate for inclusion in the <emphasis
      role="distribution">Testing</emphasis> distribution — a group of
      <emphasis role="distribution">Unstable</emphasis> packages chosen
      according to some quantifiable criteria. Every day a program
      automatically selects the packages to include in <emphasis
      role="distribution">Testing</emphasis>, according to elements
      guaranteeing a certain level of quality:</para>
      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
	  <para>lack of critical bugs, or, at least fewer than the version
	  currently included in <emphasis
	  role="distribution">Testing</emphasis>;</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
	  <para>at least 10 days spent in <emphasis

	  moved there together with the package in question.</para>
        </listitem>
      </orderedlist>

      <para>This system is clearly not infallible; critical bugs are
      regularly found in packages included in <emphasis
      role="distribution">Testing</emphasis>. Still, it is generally
      effective, and <emphasis role="distribution">Testing</emphasis> poses
      far fewer problems than <emphasis
      role="distribution">Unstable</emphasis>, being for many, a good
      compromise between stability and novelty.</para>

      <sidebar>
        <title><emphasis>NOTE</emphasis> Limitations of <emphasis role="distribution">Testing</emphasis></title>

	<para>While very interesting in principle, <emphasis
	role="distribution">Testing</emphasis> does have some practical
	problems: the tangle of cross-dependencies between packages is such
	that a package can rarely move there completely on its own. With
	packages all depending upon each other, it is sometimes necessary to migrate a
	large number of packages simultaneously, which is impossible when some are
	uploading updates regularly. On the other hand, the script
	identifying the families of related packages works hard to create
	them (this would be an NP-complete problem, for which, fortunately,
	we know some good heuristics). This is why we can manually interact
	with and guide this script by suggesting groups of packages, or
	imposing the inclusion of certain packages in a group, even if this
	temporarily breaks some dependencies. This functionality is
	accessible to the Release Managers and their assistants.</para>

	<para>Recall that an NP-complete problem is of an exponential
	algorithmic complexity according to the size of the data, here
	being the length of the code (the number of figures) and the
	elements involved. The only way to resolve it is frequently to
	examine all possible configurations, which could require enormous
	means. A heuristic is an approximate, but satisfying,
	solution.</para>

	<para>We also have Stable Release Managers, often abbreviated SRM,
	who manage and select updates for the current stable version of

    <section>
      <title>The Promotion from <emphasis role="distribution">Testing</emphasis> to <emphasis role="distribution">Stable</emphasis></title>

      <para>Let us suppose that our package is now included in <emphasis
      role="distribution">Testing</emphasis>. As long as it has room for
      improvement, its maintainer must continue to improve it and
      restart the process from <emphasis
      role="distribution">Unstable</emphasis> (but its later inclusion in
      <emphasis role="distribution">Testing</emphasis> is generally faster:
      unless it changed significantly, all of its dependencies are
      already available). When it reaches perfection, the maintainer has
      completed their work. The next step is the inclusion in the <emphasis
      role="distribution">Stable</emphasis> distribution, which is, in
      reality, a simple copy of <emphasis
      role="distribution">Testing</emphasis> at a moment chosen by the
      Release Manager. Ideally this decision is made when the installer is
      ready, and when no program in <emphasis
      role="distribution">Testing</emphasis> has any known critical
      bugs.</para>

      <para>Since this moment never truly arrives, in practice, Debian must
      compromise: remove packages whose maintainer has failed to correct
      bugs on time, or agree to release a distribution with some bugs in
      the thousands of programs. The Release Manager will have previously
      announced a freeze period, during which each update to <emphasis
      role="distribution">Testing</emphasis> must be approved. The goal
      here is to prevent any new version (and its new bugs), and to only
      approve updates fixing bugs.</para>

	<para>During the freeze period, development of the <emphasis
	role="distribution">Testing</emphasis> distribution is blocked; no
	more automatic updates are allowed. Only the Release Managers are
	then authorized to change packages, according to their own
	criteria. The purpose is to prevent the appearance of new bugs by
	introducing new versions; only thoroughly examined updates are
	authorized when they correct significant bugs.</para>
      </sidebar>

      <para>After the release of a new stable version, the Stable Release
      Manager manages all further development (called “revisions”, ex:
      5.0.1, 5.0.2, 5.0.3 for version 5.0). These updates systematically
      include all security patches. They will also include the most
      important corrections (the maintainer of a package must prove the
      gravity of the problem that they wish to correct in order to have
      their updates included).</para>

      <para>At the end of the journey, our hypothetical package is now included in
      the stable distribution. This journey, not without its difficulties,
      explains the significant delays separating the Debian Stable
      releases. This contributes, over all, to its reputation for quality.

      servers, don't need the latest and greatest version of GNOME; they can choose Debian
      <emphasis role="distribution">Stable</emphasis>, and they will be
      satisfied. End users, more interested in the latest versions of GNOME
      or KDE than in rock-solid stability, will find Debian <emphasis
      role="distribution">Testing</emphasis> to be a good compromise
      between a lack of serious problems and relatively up to date
      software. Finally, developers and more experienced users may blaze
      the trail, testing all the latest developments in Debian <emphasis
      role="distribution">Unstable</emphasis> right out of the gate, at the
      risk of suffering the headaches and bugs inherent in any new version
      of a program. To each their own Debian!</para>

	<para>GNOME (GNU Network Object Model Environment) and KDE (K
	Desktop Environment) are the two most popular graphical desktop
	environments in the free software world. A desktop environment is a
	set of programs grouped together to allow easy management of the
	most common operations through a graphical interface. They
	generally include a file manager, office suite, web browser, e-mail
	program, multimedia accessories, etc. The most visible difference
	resides in the choice of the graphical library used: GNOME has
	chosen GTK+ (free software licensed under the LGPL), and KDE has
	selected Qt (from the company, Trolltech, who released it under the
	GPL license). <ulink type="block" url="http://www.gnome.org/"/>
