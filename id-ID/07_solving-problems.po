Indeed users may sometimes wait for a problem to reoccur over several days before reporting it. You can use a specific tool to analyze the content of the larger log files. You can find such utilities for web servers (such as <command>analog</command>, <command>awstats</command>, <command>webalizer</command> for Apache), for FTP servers, for proxy/cache servers, for firewalls, for e-mail servers, for DNS servers, and even for print servers. Some of these utilities operate in a modular manner and allow analysis of several types of log files. This is the case of <command>lire</command> or also <command>modlogan</command>. Other tools, such as <command>logcheck</command> (a software discussed in <xref linkend=\"security\" />), scan these files to search for alerts to be dealt with."

In this case, the proper procedure is to report the bug to Debian or directly to the upstream developers. To do this, isolate the problem as much as possible and create a minimal test situation in which it can be reproduced. If you know which program is the apparent cause of the problem, you can find its corresponding package using the command, <command>dpkg -S <replaceable>file_in_question</replaceable></command>. Check the Bug Tracking System (<literal>http://bugs.debian.org/<replaceable>package</replaceable></literal>) to ensure that the bug has not already been reported. You can then send your own bug report, using the <command>reportbug</command> command, including as much information as possible, especially a complete description of those minimal test cases that will allow anyone to recreate the bug."
