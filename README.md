How does it work?
-------------------
Different data types can be aggregated via KISS' simple interface: apps, contacts, settings...

Each data types uses four classes:

* A *loader*, which retrieves all available items at startup
* A *provider*, which knows all of its items (e.g. all contacts), and is responsible for filtering those records according to the query
* A *pojo*, which is a [POJO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_Old_Java_Object) storing simple data for one item (e.g. contact name, display name, phone number, photo)
* A *result*, which ensures the *pojo* is properly displayed in the list

Controlling the workflow is *SummonActivity*, initializing the UI, dispatching the query to the providers and ordering the results according to their relevance and user search history.

This is clearly not as easy as it ought to be.
