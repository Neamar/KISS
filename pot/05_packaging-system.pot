This is why it has a <literal>--compare-versions</literal> option, usable by external programs (especially configuration scripts executed by <command>dpkg</command> itself). This option requires three parameters: a version number, a comparison operator, and a second version number. The different possible operators are <literal>lt</literal> (strictly less than), <literal>le</literal> (less than or equal to), <literal>eq</literal> (equal), <literal>ne</literal> (not equal), <literal>ge</literal> (greater than or equal to), and <literal>gt</literal> (strictly greater than). If the comparison is correct, <command>dpkg</command> gives the return code, 0 (success); if not, it gives a non-zero return value (indicating failure)."

This log is extremely verbose, since it details every one of the stages through which packages handled by <command>dpkg</command> go. In addition to offering a way to track dpkg's behavior, it helps, above all, to keep a history of the development of the system: one can find the exact moment when each package has been installed or updated, and this information can be extremely useful in understanding a recent change in behavior. Additionally, all versions being recorded, it is easy to cross-check the information with the <filename>changelog.Debian.gz</filename> for packages in question, or even with online bug reports."
