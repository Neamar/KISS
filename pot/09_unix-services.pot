The kernel is then initialized, and starts to search for and mount the partition containing the root filesystem, and finally executes the first program — <command>init</command>. Frequently, this “root partition” and this <command>init</command> are, in fact, located in a virtual filesystem that only exists in RAM (hence its name, “initramfs”, formerly called “initrd” for “initialization RAM disk”). This filesystem is loaded in memory by the bootloader, often from a file on a hard drive or from the network. It contains the bare minimum required by the kernel to load the “true” root filesystem: this may be driver modules for the hard drive, or other devices without which the system can not boot, or, more frequently, initialization scripts and modules for assembling RAID arrays, opening encrypted partitions, activating LVM volumes, etc. Once the root partition is mounted, the initramfs hands over control to the real init, and the machine goes back to the standard boot process."

With GRUB2, you simply add <literal>apm=on</literal> to the <literal>GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=</literal> variable in <filename>/etc/default/grub</filename>, and run <command>update-grub</command> to regenerate the contents of the boot menu."
