In some cases, the administrator needs a software feature that requires the software to be compiled from sources, with a particular compilation option; in others, the software as packaged in the installed version of Debian is not recent enough. In the latter case, the administrator will usually build a more recent package taken from a newer version of Debian — such as <emphasis role=\"distribution\">Testing</emphasis> or even <emphasis role=\"distribution\">Unstable</emphasis> — so that this new package works in their <emphasis role=\"distribution\">Stable</emphasis> distribution; this operation is called “backporting”. As usual, care should be taken, before undertaking such a task, to check whether it has been done already. This can be checked at the <literal>backports.debian.org</literal> site. <indexterm><primary>backport</primary></indexterm>"

msgid "Rebuilding a Debian package starts with getting its source code. The easiest way is to use the <command>apt-get source <replaceable>source-package-name</replaceable></command> command. This command requires a <literal>deb-src</literal> line in the <filename>/etc/apt/sources.list</filename> file, and up-to-date index files (i.e. <command>apt-get update</command>). These conditions should already be met if you followed the instructions from the chapter dealing with APT configuration (see <xref linkend=\"sect.apt-sources.list\" />). Note however, that you'll be downloading the source packages from the Debian version mentioned in the <literal>deb-src</literal> line. If you need another version, you may need to download it manually from a Debian mirror or from the web site. This involves fetching two or three files (with extensions <filename>*.dsc</filename> — for <emphasis>Debian Source Control</emphasis> — <filename>*.tar.<replaceable>comp</replaceable></filename>, and sometimes <filename>*.diff.gz</filename> or <filename>*.debian.tar.<replaceable>comp</replaceable></filename> — <replaceable>comp</replaceable> taking one value among <literal>gz</literal>, <literal>bz2</literal>, <literal>lzma</literal> or <literal>xz</literal> depending on the compression tool in use), then run the <command>dpkg-source -x <replaceable>file.dsc</replaceable></command> command. If the <filename>*.dsc</filename> file is directly accessible at a given URL, there's an even simpler way to fetch it all, with the <command>dget <replaceable>URL</replaceable></command> command. This command (which can be found in the <emphasis role=\"pkg\">devscripts</emphasis> package) fetches the <filename>*.dsc</filename> file at the given address, then analyzes its contents, and automatically fetches the file or files referenced within. With the <literal>-x</literal> option, the source package is even unpacked locally after download."

Such a change is best effected with the <command>dch</command> command (<emphasis>Debian CHangelog</emphasis>) from the <emphasis role=\"pkg\">devscripts</emphasis> package, with an invocation such as <command>dch -v 3.0.24-6.falcot1</command>.

These often refer to versions of packages contained in the distribution the source package comes from, but which may not be available in the distribution used for the rebuild. There is no automated way to determine if a dependency is real or only specified to guarantee that the build should only be attempted with the latest version of a library — this is the only available way to force an <emphasis>autobuilder</emphasis> to use a given package version during build, which is why Debian maintainers frequently use strictly versioned build-dependencies."

Reading the files which document the standard way of building the software — these files are often called <filename>INSTALL</filename> — will help you figure out the appropriate dependencies. Ideally, all dependencies should be satisfiable from the distribution used for the rebuild; if they are not, a recursive process starts, whereby the packages mentioned in the <literal>Build-Depends</literal> field must be backported before the target package can be. Some packages may not need backporting, and can be installed as-is during the build process (a notable example is <emphasis role=\"pkg\">debhelper</emphasis>). Note that the backporting process can quickly become complex if you are not vigilant. Therefore, backports should be kept to a strict minimum when possible."
