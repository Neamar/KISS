Since these time slices are very short (in the millisecond range), they create the illusion of processes running in parallel, although they're actually only active during some time intervals and idle the rest of the time. The kernel's job is to adjust its scheduling mechanisms to keep that illusion, while maximizing the global system performance. If the time slices are too long, the application may lack in snappiness and user interactivity. Too short, and the system loses time switching tasks too frequently. These decisions can be tweaked with process priorities. High-priority processes will run for longer and more frequent time slices than low-priority processes."
