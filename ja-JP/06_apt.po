These packages are called “automatic” and are tagged with an “A” in the list of packages — they often include libraries for instance. When a package is removed, the corresponding automatic packages are also selected for removal unless another “manually installed” package depends on them. It is possible to mark a package as automatic (with <keycombo action=\"simul\"><keycap>Shift</keycap> <keycap>m</keycap></keycombo>) or to remove the mark (<keycombo><keycap>m</keycap></keycombo> key). When maintaining a system with <command>aptitude</command>, it is a good habit to mark as automatic any package that you don't need directly so that they are automatically removed when they aren't necessary anymore. You can either navigate the list of installed packages and play with <keycombo action=\"simul\"><keycap>Shift</keycap> <keycap>m</keycap></keycombo>, or apply the flag to entire sections (for example the <literal>libs</literal> section). This habit can help you to keep your system tidy and offers a simple way to visualize the packages in use on a machine, without all the libraries and dependencies that you don't really care about. The related pattern that can be used with <keycombo><keycap>l</keycap></keycombo> (to activate the filter mode) is <literal>~i!~M</literal>.
